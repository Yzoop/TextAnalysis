Putin can claim as a victory ahead of a highly symbolic holiday, Russian forces on Thursday aimed their firepower at key points along the eastern front, launching missiles at a strategic city and mounting a final, potentially bloody push to seize the last Ukrainian bastion in the port city of Mariupol.\n\nThough Moscowâs renewed offensive has yet to yield major gains, Russian forces pressing into Ukraine from the east took aim at the city of Kramatorsk and, to the south in Mariupol, breached Ukrainian defenses around the Azovstal steel plant, where only fighters holed up in underground bunkers stand in the way of Moscow declaring complete control over the ruined city.\n\nA Ukrainian commander, Lt. Col. Denys Prokopenko, said âheavy, bloody battlesâ were being fought in the plantâs subterranean labyrinth of bunkers and fallout shelters. Officials estimated that about 200 civilians were still hiding with the last soldiers defending the city, which has become a symbol of both Ukrainian resistance and Russian devastation, and has suffered one of the more searing humanitarian crises of the 10-week-old war.\n\nThere are growing fears among Western officials that Mr. Putin could use Victory Day, a Russian holiday commemorating the Soviet Unionâs triumph over Nazi Germany, on Monday to turn what he calls a âspecial military operationâ in Ukraine into explicit, all-out war, and to mobilize Russians for a broader conflict. On Wednesday, the Kremlin dismissed such concerns as ânonsense.â\n\nIn other major developments:\n\nThe United States scheduled a U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine for Thursday, the first to be led by the United States since the war began in February.\n\nThe New York Times reported that the United States has provided Ukraine with real-time intelligence that American officials say has led to the killings of Russian generals, another sign of the deepening Western commitment to Kyiv.\n\nThe E.U. ban on Russian oil proposed on Wednesday by the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is expected to be approved by member states within days. The phased-in ban would limit Russiaâs ability to finance the war, though not immediately.\n\nUkrainian forces reclaimed several villages around the eastern city of Kharkiv and pushed Russian forces back some two dozen miles from the city, according to Ukrainian officials and military analysts, putting civilian areas that have suffered weeks of bombardment out of reach of Russian artillery.",

In the 17 th century the English scientist and mathematician Isaac Newton wondered why the moon and the planets didnât simply fly off into outer space but always moved in a curve around the Earth and the sun. He found out that the same force that pulled an apple back to the ground also kept the moon moving around the Earth.\n\nHe discovered that the moonâs orbit is the result of two different movements. The first motion makes the moon fly along a straight line in space. A planet will always follow such a line if nothing else changes its direction or speed. The second force pulls the moon towards the Earth. If you put both movements together you get a curved path around the Earth.\n\nNewton also found out that every body or object has a force of gravity , and that every body pulls other bodies towards it. He also explained that gravity depends on the mass of an object or the amount of material that it has. Therefore the sun, which has a very large mass, has a greater force of gravity than the Earth, so the Earth moves around the sun. The moon goes around the Earth because the Earthâs gravity is larger than the moonâs.\n\nThe force of gravity also depends on the distance between two objects. If they are close together gravity between them is greater.",

It is very small if you compare it with the whole atom and it has almost all of an atomâs mass. If an atom had a diameter of about 6 km the nucleus would only be as big as a tennis ball. The rest of the atom outside the nucleus is mostly empty.\n\nElectrons fly around in an atom very, very quickly. They have almost no mass and travel around the nucleus millions of times every second.\n\nThe parts of an atom have electrical charges. Each proton carries a positive electrical charge and each electron has a negative electrical charge. Neutrons have no charge. In most cases an atom has the same number of protons and electrons. It is electrically neutral.\n\nThe energy of the nucleus keeps the electron inside the atomâjust like the Earth keeps the moon in its orbit. But electrons have energy themselves. They want to break away from the nucleus. If an electron has a lot of energy it moves around farther away from the nucleus.\n\nElectrons move around the nucleus in up to seven round paths , called shells. The first shell is closest to the nucleus. It can hold two electrons. The second shell can hold 8, the third 18 and the fourth 32 electrons. In most atoms, the outer shells are never completely filled with electrons. The inner electrons travel fastest, the outer ones are the slowest.",

It depends on\n\nthe distance from the centre of the Earth\nthe spin or rotation of the Earth\nA house at the seaside, for example, is closer to the Earthâs centre. Gravity is stronger here than at a house up in the mountains.\n\n \n\nThe Earthâs spin also reduces the strength of gravity. The centrifugal force causes a body or an object to move in a straight line unless something tries to change its path. At the equator the centrifugal effect is greater than anywhere else on our planet. An object must travel 40,000 km during one rotation of the planet. The distance and the centrifugal force decrease when you move towards the poles. Therefore you would weigh more at the poles than at the equator.\n\nFor this reason spacecraft are launched from places that are as near to the equator as possible. In this way it takes less fuel and power to escape the Earthâs gravitational force and get into orbit.\n\nGravity also holds our atmosphere together. We wouldnât see any clouds or rain if there were no gravity.",

But others were very different from the ones that live on our Earth now. Great dinosaurs that were up to 40 meters long and big flying reptiles with wingspans of 12 meters were among them.\n\nScientists have learned a lot about these prehistoric animals by studying fossils. They are signs of life that can be found inside an old rock. They may be shells, bones or animal tracks. Scientists remove the fossils from the rock and study them. By doing this they can tell where, when and how the animals lived.\nPrehistoric animals lived during three main eras of the Earthâs history.\n\nUp to the Paleozoic period animals lived mostly in the seas. During this era, which lasted from about 600 million to 240 million years ago, animals started coming out of the water and living on land. Many forms of life developed during this time, like insects and small reptiles. Amphibians were creatures that lived on land and in the water.\nThe Mesozoic era was known as the Age of Reptiles. It lasted from about 240 million to 65 million years ago. At the end of this age the dinosaurs and many other reptiles died out. Scientists do not know for sure why they died out so quickly, but some think it was because of a sudden change in climate.\nThe Cenozoic era is known as the Age of Mammals. It began about 65 million years ago and is the period we now live in. Mammals are animals that feed their babies with their motherâs milk. The most famous mammal was the mammoth",

They use these pictures to see which bones are broken or to find out which teeth have holes in them.\n\nTo produce X-ray pictures you need two things: a special plate that can capture X-rays is placed behind a part of a personâs body. A machine that produces X-rays is put in front of the person.\nThe X-rays are strong enough to pass through the skin and muscles but they cannot pass through hard objects like bones. In the picture you see hard objects, like bones, as white areas. Objects that X-rays go through are dark.\nThere are some situations in which X-rays cannot give you a clear picture. Some organs, for example, may block X-rays from showing a broken bone. For this reason computed tomography (CT) was invented. A person is put inside a scanner, which is a large tube-shaped machine. Then he is X-rayed from all sides. A computer puts together all of these images and can show doctors more than a normal X-ray can. CTs are used for brain diseases and head injuries.\n\nX-rays, however, can also do harm to your body. Patients must wear special protection for the parts of their body that are not X-rayed. Doctors and helpers who work with X-ray machines must wear lead aprons and stand behind screens.\n\nX-rays are sometimes used to in the fight against cancer. Doctors often beam X-rays at cancer cells in order to destroy them",

The core gets smaller but the temperature increases. The area around the core expands because of the high temperature. When a star gets very big it sometimes explodes. Such an explosion is called a supernova and lasts only for a few days. During this phase stars burn billions of times brighter than they normally do. Sometimes the material of a supernova collapses and turns into a very dense ball of matter called a neutron star. It sends out strong radio waves called pulsars.\n\nSometimes supernovas have enough energy and mass to collapse inward. They become a black hole.

Some astronomers think that the moons are like asteroids that were captured by Mars very early in its history.\n\nIf you look at Mars without a telescope you can see a reddish object that is sometimes very bright. When it is closest to the earth - at about 55 million km - Mars is, after Venus, the brightest object in the sky. Through a telescope, Mars has bright orange and darker areas. Some of the colors change with Martian seasons.\n\nThe Martian atmosphere is mostly made up of carbon dioxide with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and water. It is very thin and high yellowish clouds can often be seen. Scientists think they are made up of dust that is carried around by high winds on the planet.\n\nThe temperatures on Mars depend on the season and the time of day. But most of the time it is very cold. Summer temperatures may get as high as 17Â° C - but on average they don't get much higher than -30Â°C. The coldest parts of the planet are down to - 125 Â°. That's why the carbon dioxide freezes , turns white and forms the polar ice caps . In the winter they cover almost half of the planet and in the summer they get smaller as the sunlight melts them. They are about 300 km wide at the South Pole and more than 1,000 km wide at the North Pole. They are probably made up of frozen water and gases and may be up to 2.5 km thick.\n\nSome of the surface of Mars consists of the biggest volcanoes in the solar system. One of them , Olympus Mons , is 25 km high and 600 km wide. There is no sign that volcanoes are active today. There are also many craters because in its early days Mars was hit very hard by asteroids and comets. Canyons run for over thousands of kilometers across the surface .\n\nMost of the knowledge we have about Mars has come from spaceships that have been sent to visit the planet since 1964. The first views of Mars came from spacecraft that flew by the planet at a larger distance. The first spacecraft to orbit the planet was Mariner 9 . It studied the atmosphere and the surface for almost a year and gave scientists the first pictures of its two moons. In 1976, two Viking spacecraft landed on Mars and took a look at the surface of the planet. In 1997, Mars Pathfinder, set down on the surface and a 10kg heavy vehicle, called Sojourner, moved around the planet and examined rocks.\n\n",

A resurgence of household spending and business investment is colliding with a messy reordering of the supply of goods and labor.\n\nLabor force participation has quickly recovered, nearing prepandemic rates, but has failed to keep up with the surge in job opportunities over the past year as business owners expand to meet the demand for a variety of goods and services.\n\nAfter a sharp climb last year, job openings plateaued somewhat. The March reading suggests that the decline in acute coronavirus concerns among experts and the average consumer â paired with the rolling back of public health restrictions and the start of the summer hiring season â is increasing businessesâ appetites for more workers. Layoffs and discharges remained uncommon, and relatively flat compared to the previous month, at 1.4 million.\nThe Federal Reserve is raising the cost of borrowing as part of an effort to cool consumer spending, business lending and demand for workers. Markets expect the Fed to announce a half-percentage point increase in its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday.",

Undermining sanctions, a U.S. official starkly warned, could bring âconsequences.â Taking a harder line on Russia, a parade of American and European emissaries argued, is a global imperative.\n\nBut for India, the decision to hold tight to its neutrality on Russiaâs war in Ukraine is no longer just about keeping its options open in a world with multiple centers of power. It has evolved into a lucrative case of economic opportunism: Russian oil is just too good a deal to pass up.\n\nIndiaâs purchases of Russian crude have soared since the conflictâs start, rising from nothing in December and January to about 300,000 barrels a day in March and 700,000 a day in April. The crude now accounts for nearly 17 percent of Indian imports, up from less than 1 percent before the invasion. Last year, India imported about 33,000 barrels a day on average from Russia.\nWith Russian oil banned in the United States and Europe now proposing an embargo of its own, India can buy the crude at substantial discounts, powering its energy-thirsty economy at a lower cost. Indian refiners can also use the crude to make products like diesel and jet fuel and sell it at better-than-usual margins abroad.",

Wade.\n\nThe finance giants could follow the lead of Citigroup Inc. and pay travel expenses for employees seeking to end pregnancies away from states with restrictive abortion laws, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. Some senior leaders remain wary of the growing criticism by Republican lawmakers. \n\nThe move has consequences across Wall Street and beyond as corporate America struggles to balance employee demands with the risk of political backlash. Late Monday, Politico reported that a draft Supreme Court opinion would overturn the Roe decision that legalized abortion throughout the U.S. five decades ago -- a draft the court later said was authentic but not final. Polls have shown the unpopularity of overturning Roe, which has given some Wall Street firms cover to act even as much of the business world remained silent after Texas last year passed one of the nationâs most restrictive laws on abortion. \n\nâIf thereâs a silver lining of this leak, itâs that itâs pushed corporate America into getting its house in order before itâs too late,â said Jen Stark, the incoming co-director of the Center for Business and Social Justice, where sheâll work with corporations on health issues. On Wall Street, she said, Citigroupâs early move will pay off. âThey caught the heat. But now theyâre a step ahead.â\n\nA spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment. A person involved with the discussion said the bank is reviewing its policies and the impact a Supreme Court ruling may have on state laws and health-care choice. A JPMorgan representative also declined to comment.\n\nAt New York-based Goldman, a key consideration has been to avoid upsetting politicians on the right, whoâve increasingly sought to exact commercial punishment on companies taking left-leaning stances on social issues.",

In total, some 266 million pounds ($328 million) was banked by NatWest Group Plc and then laundered, prosecutors allege.\n\nEcclestone isnât a defendant in the case and hasnât been accused of wrongdoing. Stunt is one of eight people standing trial over allegations of laundering cash from criminal activity.\n\nThe financing arrangement, provided by Canadaâs Bank of Nova Scotia, was intended to help pay for branded gold bars and coins. Instead, the money was used to acquire gold that would be broken up and destined for Dubai, Nicholas Clarke, the lead prosecution lawyer, said. The Canadian bank isnât alleged to have done any wrongdoing.\n\nScotiabank also delivered around 50 million pounds of gold -- some 1700 kilograms -- to Stuntâs firm. Stunt, who was previously married to Ecclestoneâs daughter Petra, says he didnât know the cash was criminal and has denied any misconduct.

And thatâs why itâs one of life's true delights, because it can be enjoyed by anyone and everyone. With films, you need to understand what is being said and with books, you need to be able to read, but music has no boundaries, no prerequisites and is accessible for all. I donât think there are many things in life that have such a direct and visible impact on someoneâs mood. Obviously there are some people who are less bothered by music, and of course it depends on what sort of music theyâre into, but watching someone react when they hear one of their favourite songs is actually the best thing ever.\n\nPersonally, Iâm a big disco/soul/funk kind of girl. I like to just call it boogie music because for me, I donât see how you canât not dance when you hear it. It instantly changes my mood and you can see it in my face straight away (Iâm that idiot bounding down the street with their headphones on and a great big smile on their face). But I donât care, because music makes me feel good and has the power to join you with other people in this shared moment where exchanging words isnât necessary.\n\nI think music has such an impact on people because it taps into their feelings and always carries a story. And I donât just mean in the lyrics but in the history of where the genre has originated from, how itâs evolved over time, who performs it, who listens to it. Everyone who partakes in experiencing music develops the story that bit more and winds it into a page of their own story.\n\nDiscovering new styles is a great way into a new culture. Iâm currently in Madrid and have been enjoying salsa and reggaeton which are historic here but thanks to La Movida MadrileÃ±a, thereâs a huge array of genres and clubs. From disco at Bogui to house at Mondo, techno at Sala Sol and salsa at Son, Madrid has it all. So wherever youâre living right now, I recommend you to get involved in the music scene and you might stumble across something you really love, or at the very least, youâll partake in something special with other people.",

It is something that is part of us ever since we enter this world. Our mothers, fathers and grandparents sing us lullabies so that we can sleep peacefully. In the mornings, we listen to the birds chirping and the leaves of plants and trees rustling, and even this is like music to our ears. Music is everywhere, and all you have to do is open up your ears to hear it.\n\nThose who know how to create music using instruments and their own bodies are called musicians. There are different kinds of instruments â percussion, string, brass, woodwind and piano/keyboard. Percussion instruments include drums, bongos, the triangle, tambourine, tabla, dholak, etc. and they are the ones responsible for giving the main beat to a song. String instruments include the harp, guitar, cello, violin, etc. and they give rhythm to the music.\n\nBrass instruments refer to those that you have to play with your mouth, such as the trombone, trumpet, the French horn, etc. In these instruments, you blow air into the instruments to create vibrations. Woodwind instruments follow a similar concept using air/wind, except that these instruments are made of wood and the sound profile is higher pitched than brass, for example, the flute. The piano/keyboard consists of a set of keys that have a range of pitches.\n\nWhen musicians put one or more of these sounds together in harmony, it creates what we know as music. However, thatâs not all to it; music can be even one of those instruments, such as the strumming of a guitar, a melodious tune on the piano, a catchy beat on the bongos, etc. When you add another voice to an instrument, it is called singing and is a vital part of the music. When people who play different instruments come together to play them together, it is called a band.\n\nThere are many different genres of music, too, such as rock, pop, classical, blues, jazz, R&B, hip-hop, etc. All of these genres of music are characterized by how the instruments work together. For example, rock music is often louder and has more pronounced percussion and string instruments, while jazz is a genre where the saxophone is very prevalent. In todayâs world, we see a lot of combinations of genres such as pop-rock, classical rock, etc. One of the newest genres of music is electronic dance music (EDM) which consists of loud percussive beats and is very popular to young people.\n\nThey say that music is a universal language, meaning that you donât necessarily need to understand the words in a song to enjoy the music. In this way, music connects people all over the world with its universal language. I love listening to music especially because of this reason. Music has the power to unite people, make us feel at peace, make us feel understood; it is something to dance to, bond over, and even listen to when alone. Music is not just sound, it is its own language and it communicates so much; it is a beautiful thing.",

Ivy wore an haute couture creation by John Galliano for Maison Margiela made of mirrors; her friend, the actor Anya Taylor-Joy, was her maid of honor; Nancy Pelosi officiated. She explains that it came after a very tough year: In September 2020, her grandmother passed away; two months later, she lost her father. She muses that, in her mind, the fÃªte was almost a way to honor the house itselfâthe place that had once rung with laughter and soaring voices.\n\nToday she is wearing a pair of HermÃ¨s trousers, an HermÃ¨s alligator belt, and a Balmain jacket, all of which came straight out of her grandmotherâs closet. âShe always tried to get me to dress like her,â Ivy says, âand now Iâm wearing all her clothes, all of the time.â Over her shoulder is slung a rare Himalaya crocodile Dior saddle bag, and she has capped all this lusciousness with a filmy Catherine Malandrino leopard top she found on The RealReal for $40. (The blouse is unable to conceal a number of tattoos that are in the process of being erased. Her grandmother hated them. âA lot of people get tattoos when someone passes away,â Ivy says. âFor me, itâs the opposite.â)\n\nHer late grandmotherâs deep wardrobe notwithstanding, Ivy is also an avid vintage-clothes collector, and so we say goodbye to the JAR jewelry and decide to explore another way of dressing up: by going out and looking at things that belong to someone elseâs grandmother, or motherâclothes with their own (far less intimidating) secret histories. At Screaming Mimiâs on West 14th Street, Ivy, who is 27 and therefore born in 1994, shares that she is obsessed with the 1980sâshe listens to Boy George, and has never met a Pucci print or a baby doll dress she didnât like. A Mugler jumpsuit from that era proves irresistible, what with shoulders that are not shy and a scarf tie that can cradle the neck in any number of dashing ways.\n\n",

The hosts, locations, and guests change every year, but hereâs the gist of the late-night lineup: One party is usually hosted by a well-funded corporate sponsor, and has the best cocktails and decor by far. Another is thrown by an impossibly chic co-chair with impossibly chic taste where, if you are lucky enough to get an invite, you spend the entire evening praying that you, too, can be this chic. Then, thereâs a champagne-fueled affair at the Boom Boom Room that goes well into the morning. A fourth party is always thrown by another A-lister, which no one seems to know is happening until maybe two hours before it actually does. Youâll frantically spend an hour of your night trying to get on the list.\n\nFor the famous faces attending the Met Gala, the after-parties act as a sort of secretive second red carpet of the night, where they debut high-fashion night-out looks mere hours after their formal gala fits. Except this time the cameras arenât just in one placeâtheyâre all over New York.\n\nAt around 11 p.m., the ballgowns off and sultrier looks slapped on, celebrities and their posses of managers, press people, stylists, and general hangers-on pile into sprinter vans and go out until the wee hours. Itâs a wild, FOMOâfilled gauntlet, where youâre always trying to figure out where to go, what to wear, and how to get in. And on Monday night, this writer threw on a shimmery short Carolina Herrera dress and attempted to party hop along with them.",

        "text": "No one loves a Met Gala red carpet surprise more than Kim Kardashianâso itâs no wonder rumors of her dramatic transformation into Marilyn Monroe were swirling 48 hours before the ball. Naturally, the big reveal tonight was nothing short of jaw-dropping. âThe idea really came to me after the gala in September last year. I thought to myself, what would I have done for the American theme if it had not been the Balenciaga look? Whatâs the most American thing you can think of? And thatâs Marilyn Monroe,â says Kardashian. The instant she stepped foot on the red carpet wearing the infamous glittering dress, her hair platinum blonde and perfectly coiffed, the reference was unmistakable. âFor me the most Marilyn Monroe moment is when she sang âHappy Birthday,â to JFK, it was that look.â\n\nWhen I speak to the reality TV star and entrepreneur over the phone this past Sunday afternoon, she is in the midst of getting her hair bleached blonde. âIâm spending the whole day just dyeing my hair, 14 hours straight,â she says laughing. Kardashian clearly relishes the challenge of a tricky-to-pull-off fashion moment. Between the impossibly waist-whittled âwet lookâ Mugler dress she wore in 2019 and the mysterious Balenciaga Zentai-style outfit she donned last year, sheâs especially game to go the extra mile for the Met Gala. Still, orchestrating a style maneuver of this magnitude would require new levels of commitment and planning.",

I think this one had to do with meâit reminded her of ivy leaves,â Ivy Getty says, pointing toâbut not touching!âa spectacular brooch of emeralds, peridots, green garnets, zircons, and diamonds by the renowned jewelry artist Joel Arthur Rosenthal, known as JAR, displayed with 11 other JAR jewels on trays in a private room at Christieâs in Manhattan.\n\nThese glittering prizes, each of which was once owned by Ivyâs grandmother Ann Getty, are set to be auctioned as the leading lights of Christieâs Magnificent Jewels auction on June 8. For jewelry aficionados, and I am one, the opportunity to view this many JARs is a once-in-a-lifetime event: Here is a multi-gem fleur-de-lis brooch with a somber shimmer evoking stained glass; there is a pair of unmatched earrings, each designed as a fantastical oak leaf in a mÃ©lange of tourmalines, garnets, amethysts, sapphires, emeralds, aquamarines, andâwhy not?âround diamonds.\n\nBut Ivy, who was raised in San Francisco by her grandparents, saw these extraordinary pieces up close and personal on a daily basis. âShe didnât keep these locked up in a vault,â Ivy remembers. âShe wore them all the time, but she wasnât ostentatiousâshe would never tell me what she had. She wanted me to just appreciate her things as art. Her taste was so elite.â",

Music is one of the most calming and soothing things if you let it be. It comes from melodies and tunes strung together by people who sing and play musical instruments. The power of music shows in the simplest of things, such as when you absentmindedly tap your foot to a beat or hum a tune unknowingly.\n\nMusic is not only created by people, but it is also all around us in nature. In the mornings, when the crickets and the birds chirp, it is music. The loud sound of the waves in the ocean swishing, the whistle in the wind, and the sound of trees and leaves rustling are all their own forms of music.",

        "text": " Almost six months to the day since the death of Virgil Abloh, whose many achievements include the creation of Off-White, the label that is central to his legacy began detailing those who will succeed him. In a post on Instagram, Off-White announced Ib Kamara in the role of art and image director. The platform used was especially appropriate, as the post detailed: âIbrahimâs relationship with Virgil and Off-White born and nurtured through DM messages on Instagram, blossomed both personally and professionally in the last three years creating a strong bond based on mutual respect and shared values. In the new role, he will further develop his influence and insight on the brandâs collections, image, and content.â\n\nA few minutes later Kamara reposted his portrait, commenting: âVirgil will forever be with us. With me. He changed the world and left an indelible mark on anyone who encountered him and beyond. Generous with his time, mind and creativityâhe saw everyone and created with all humans in mind. I am honored to further link my ties to Off-White as their art and image director and be a part of the team that will tell the rest of the story Virgil started writing for us all.â\n\nFollowing Off-Whiteâs show in Paris this February, Davide De Giglio, co-founder of its parent company New Guards Group, signaled that the only way to continue the true spirit of Off-White would be to recruit a multitude of talents. Todayâs announcement establishes one part of that collective.\n\nAndrea Grilli, who has served as Off-Whiteâs CEO since 2019, said: âIn the wake of Virgilâs tragic passing we have been working tirelessly to keep his legacy alive and the brand relevant as a point of reference and platform in constant evolution. Inspired by Virgilâs vision and approach to his art we have nourished a collective of creative minds that represent the best in their category and have a strong and personal connection with Virgil. Having Ibrahim on board, who has been part of the Off-White family for years styling our shows, to oversee art and creative of the brand in this next chapter is a great honor. With his talent and vision we look forward to taking on the next chapter of Off-White together, always remembering the groundbreaking creativity and values that Virgil had at heart and that are the core of our brand.â\n",

It was about creating dresses that were flattering, paying a lot of attention to seaming details in this case because this is a tight knit jersey. All of the garments really cinch you in at the waist, they hug your curves, and they really do celebrate a womanâs body.â Itâs true. When Beckham launched her line at New York Fashion Week in spring 2009, Nicole Phelps wrote for Vogue, âThe silhouette is beyond body-conscious, ultra-fitted from shoulder line to below the knee, with special seams along the derriÃ¨re and torso to ensure against flat rear ends and busts, respectively.â\n\nNow, over a decade later, Beckham has been inspired to wholly embrace clingy silhouettes after spending time in Miami during lockdown. âPeople really celebrate their bodies,â she says of the beach city. âItâs definitely a âless is moreâ approach to dressing, which is very different to what we know in London or New York or Paris. Itâs not about burying ourselves under too many items of clothing.â The collection is made entirely with heavy jersey fabric, in a range of neutral colors from blush to black, plus traffic cone orange for the color-block effect Beckham is so fond of. The jersey fabric, âholds you in,â so you could wear a bandeau as an underpinning and forgo shapewear. In addition to mini dresses, bandeau tops, and one-shoulder midi dresses are split-hem leggings and skirt setsâgoing-out clothes for sophisticates. âBy the time I was in Miami and I was going out, I wanted to get my body out,â Beckham explains. \n",

        "text": "Based on a sketch by Bob Mackie for the French-born Hollywood costume designer Jean-Louis, the dress caused a stir when the actress wore it to serenade President John F. Kennedy on his 45th birthday in 1962. In the brief film footage of her performance, you can hear the audience gasp as she peels off her white fur coat to reveal the sparkling translucent look embellished with over six thousand crystals. âNowadays everyone wears sheer dresses, but back then that was not the case,â says Kardashian. âIn a sense, itâs the original naked dress. Thatâs why it was so shocking.â\n\nFresh out of college and just 21 at the time, Mackie remembers the moment vividly. âAfter the day the sketch was drawn, I had no idea what it was for until photos of the event appeared in the newspaper,â he says. âMarilyn looked amazing and accomplished exactly what she intended to. Fox Studios would not let her wear anything too revealing in films, because of the previous nude calendar scandal. And she didnât really care, because she had already been fired. Her figure was at its peak, the dress was a classic shape of fashion at the time.â\nMonroe is said to have paid Jean-Louis $1,440 for the custom piece, which was first sold at auction in 1999 for over a million dollars as part of a sale of her estate with Christieâs. It then sold for a whooping $4.8 million at Julienâs Auctions in 2016, and was later acquired by Ripleyâs Believe It Or Not Museum. To this day, it holds the record for being the most expensive dress sold at auction. âIâm a big fan of auctions and I own several JFK pieces so I know the owner of Julienâs. He was able to connect me [with Ripleyâs] and thatâs how the conversation started,â says Kardashian.\n",

Before Ripleyâs would agree to loan Kardashian the piece, she was invited to try on a replica for size. It fit perfectly. Soon after, the original dress was winging its way via private plane from Orlando, Florida to Kardashianâs home in Calabasas. And yet somehow the second fitting didnât quite go as planned. âThe dress was transported by guards and I had to wear gloves to try it on,â she explains. âI always thought she was extremely curvy. I imagined I might be smaller in some places where she was bigger and bigger in places where she was smaller. So when it didnât fit me I wanted to cry because it canât be altered at all.â\nWith only a few months to go before the gala, there were only two choices: slim down to fit into the dress or find something else to wear. In her mind, there was only one real option. âIt was this or nothing,â she says flatly. In the weeks that followed, Kardashian would adhere to a strict diet to get closer to her goal. âI would wear a sauna suit twice a day, run on the treadmill, completely cut out all sugar and all carbs, and just eat the cleanest veggies and protein,â she explains. âI didnât starve myself, but I was so strict.â A month later, she was inside the Ripleyâs vaults in Orlando for the final fitting. This time around, the dress fit like a glove. âI wanted to cry tears of joy when it went up,â she says.\n",

        "text": "People love music because it is a form of entertainment but do they really understand music for what it is and not just the sound? What is music? Is it just the melody, the lyrics, the art of performance or the people doing it? Music is basically an art and a cultural activity that is in form of organized sound. Music is appreciated all over the world and it is different for everyone.\n\nMy perception on music may be focused on the rhythm and another personâs perception may be focused on the message being delivered. Music has been in existence since the beginning of time. Transformations have occurred with modernization and civilization. However, some music is still deep-rooted into culture and has not been influenced by the changing times. Music is of great importance in humanity. Although music is appreciated worldwide, it is faced with challenges.\n\nGenres of Music:\n\nMusic is a whole world in itself that is full of diversity. Music is classified into different genres and the genre defines the aspects of music like rhythm, instruments, art of performance among others. There are many general genres of music in the world. Blues, classical music, jazz and reggae are the most common genres that are listened to across the globe. Other genres include rock, pop, folk, electronic, country and hip hop music. All these genres difference in terms of the sound they produce. Genres like rock, electronic and jazz use a lot of sound combination.\n\nFolk music is basically about culture and tradition and they always remain unchanged and uninfluenced by the changes that take place in the world. Blues, classical and reggae music are almost similar in term of sound use instrument use. It is important to consider genres of music when selecting the type of music to listen to. For educational purposes, the genres of music are not commonly used because they teach on the technical aspects of music at school. Artists can be defined by the genre of music that they sing for example hip hop musicians are known to praise money, cars and fancy fashions like chains.\n\nImportance of Music:\n\nThe reason why music is appreciated widely is because of the impact it has on the lives of individuals. Manâs interaction with sound is unavoidable because music is everywhere. Music is listened to by people for different reasons. Music is significant in our lives as entertainment, emotional response, and a way of creating income and in education.\n\nIn entertainment, music dominated the entertainment industry because it has the ability to reach everyone. Music is widely spread as it is found on the internet, in media platforms like radios and televisions, in live performance concerts, in churches and schools. Countries have also adopted music in legalities like the national anthems. Music is significant to both the culture and the economy.\n\nMusic in emotional response is widely used and that is why psychologists and psychiatrists have invented the use of music in therapy. Music triggers emotional responses. In normal life situations, when a person is sad, listening to sad music makes them even sadder but listening to happy music helps to rejuvenate the mood. Spiritual music is also important in emotional response. When worshiping God, people have learnt to use music in praise and to create a worship environment by triggering remorseful and humbling emotions in people through worship songs.\n\nMusic is a source of income for majority of people in the music industry. Although some people just do it for the passion and as a hobby, most of them gain income that is substantial t sustain their lives. Despite from wealth creation, people gain fame from music. People who have created music hits are famous and wealthy and some young musicians look up to them for inspiration and as role models.\n\nMusic is important in education as it is an art that is taught is school. In all levels of education, music is significant and is appreciated in schools. Taking music as a subject is different from what we know from the outside because it involves the technical and theoretic aspects of music that we cannot gain from just listening to music. Music can also be pursued as a career at colleges and universities.it is a career path that required hard work, determination and commitment just like any other career.\n\nChallenges Facing Music:\n\nMusic is faced with challenges which affect both the artists and the music industry. Artists are faced by challenges such as financial insufficiency to fund their music production. Producing music is expensive because you need to go through a recording studio, which are usually costly and most people cannot afford.\n\nThe music industry is a bit biased in terms of finances because there are some people who can be very talented but yet lack money to produce their music while there are rich people who are not as talented but they can afford to produce their music. The line of poverty will never be eradicated because in most situations, those with financial abilities will always have an upper hand.\n\nDrugs and substance abuse is another major challenges that is faced by artists. Most artists especially those in the secular music industry abuse drugs which could end badly for them some die of drug overdoses and some spend most of their time in rehabilitation facilities. The music industry has been highly condemned for advocating for drugs especially hip hop artists who always sing about drugs and money. Drugs and substance abuse is a major problem that is rooted in music.\n\nThe music industry faces a marketing challenge. Music is produced and then each artist is supposed to market their song for them to gain sales. In marketing, activities such as tours, concerts and media marketing are expensive. The marketing is therefore challenged and the music industry may incur financial loses during marketing.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn conclusion, music is a wide field and it is beneficial to the society. Music is to be respected and adored for its goodness.",

        "text": "Music as we know it is a form of art and a cultural activity with its medium being sound that is organised with respect to time. Definitions of the term music should generally include some common elements like rhythm (with its associated concepts like articulation, meter and tempo), pitch (it governs harmony and melody), the qualities of sonic of texture and timbre (we sometimes refer to these as the colour of musical sound). All of the different and various types or styles of music might tend to omit, de-emphasize or emphasize a few of the listed elements of music.\n\nMusic can be performed with a wide variety of vocal techniques and instruments, the vocal techniques can range from rapping to singing and there are some pieces that are solely instrumental while some others are solely vocal (examples are songs that have no instrumental accompaniment) also pieces that put together instruments and singing.\n\nWhen we want to address the term in a general form, the different activities that describe music as being a form of art or a cultural activity are the examination of aesthetic music, the study and knowledge of music and its history, music criticism and the creation and making of music works (symphonies, tunes, songs and so many more).\n\nElements of Music:\n\nThere are a lot of different elements or fundamentals of music. Based on the description of the element of music that is being used, the different elements of music can include structure, form, articulation, expression, dynamics, colour or timber, voice allocation, style, texture, harmony, melody, rhythm, tempo, pulse or beat and pitch. We can differentiate the elements of music by describing the elements of music as ârudimentary elements of musicâ and âperpetual elements of musicâ.\n\n1. Rudimentary Elements:\n\nAround the 1800s, we used the words ârudiments of musicâ and âelements of musicâ interchangeably. All of the elements that were described in manuscripts talked about the parts of music needed to become a successful musician. Writers like Estrella in recent years use the words âelements of musicâ in a very much similar way. A definition that almost accurately describes the usage is: âthe rudimentary principles of an art, science, etc.: the elements of grammarâ. The curriculum of the UK changes to âinterrelated dimensions of musicâ poses a shift back to the use of rudimentary music elements.\n\n2. Perpetual Elements:\n\nThe emergence and the start of study into psychoacoustics around the 1930s. There came the discovery that there are four attributes that are psychological and belong to music. They are timbre, time, loudness and pitch. While rudimentary elements can vary based on the personal preference of the writer, perpetual elements on the other hand always consist of a list of proven or established discrete elements that can be manipulated independently to get the desired musical effect.\n\nThe curriculum of music of US, UK and Australia feature the music elements prominently. Each one of the curriculums identifies texture, timbre, dynamics and pitch as elements, which makes all of the above listed elements agreed universally.\n\nA list of the official three versions of music elements are listed below:\n\n1. USA â articulation/style, harmony, form, rhythm, dynamics, texture, timbre and pitch.\n\n2. UK â structure, tempo, duration, dynamics, texture, timbre, pitch.\n\n3. Australia â structure, form, rhythm, expression, dynamics, texture, timbre, pitch.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMusic has contributed a lot to our society. In the world we live in today, music has become a major business. Music industry describes all of the businesses connected and related with the sale and creation of music. The industry of music is made of composers and songwriters that create different new songs with musical pieces. The sale of music is a very lucrative business and we now have online music stores like Appleâs iTunes, Spotify, tidal and so many more. Musicians also get paid a lot of money to perform at concerts and make special appearances. The industry employs a lot of other people and is a source of livelihood to millions of people worldwide.\n\nMusic therapy helps in a lot of way. It is a highly interpersonal process where a therapist that is trained employs the use of music and its various facets- spiritual, aesthetic, social, mental, emotional and physical to assist clients in improving or maintaining their health. It is safe to assume that music cuts across every area of our lives and it has had a positive impact on a lot of things. It is also important to note that there have also been negative effects of music on our society.\n",

        "text": "Music could be defined as a collection of sounds and melodies. This would be a simplistic idea of what music is and would not fully describe the place that music occupies in our lives. Music is more than a collection of sounds and melodies. Music is life, love and that place we go to find solace.\n\nFrom time immemorial, music has formed part of our history as human beings. From the old romantic empire to the reign of the Greeks, people have depended on music as a source of solace and comfort.\n\nHistory of Music:\n\nHistorians do not agree on the origin of music. Some claim that music predates the existence of humans themselves. However, historians agree that there are certain periods in history that has contributed immensely to the growth of music in the world. These periods introduced distinct sounds which are still prominent today.\n\nThe first period is the medieval era which dates from the 6th to the 16th century. During this era, only monophonic and polyphonic sounds existed. Then we moved to the renaissance which was marked by experimental sounds and rhythms. Other periods such as the baroque, classics and romantic periods also brought about several innovations in sound.\n\nThe final period, which is the 20th century, is where we are currently. Technology has taken over how we make and perform music. Thus, we produce sounds through the use of electronic component and perform in the same way. This period is also notable for introducing jazz and electronic music.\n\nGenre of Music:\n\nThere are countless genres of music and new ones keep emerging on a daily basis. While some are a combination of already existing sounds others are a total break from the norm.\n\nBelow are the few popular music genres:\n\n1. Pop â Also known as popular music is a combination of several sounds produced for a large audience.\n\n2. Rhythm and Blues â Just as the name implies, this is a combination of two prominent styles. It has an infusion of soul music delivered through rhymes.\n\n3. Electronic music â As opposed to the use of natural instruments, electronic music employs the use of technology to develop unique sounds.\n\n4. Rock â This music form has its root in America. It is notable for its combination of string instruments and heavy sounds.\n\nImportance of Music:\n\nMusic in its basic form is a combination of sounds and melody. Why then is it so important to us? The following are some of the reasons:\n\nMusic is Universal:\n\nCitizens of the world are divided by language, race, and a host of other things. However, one instance when the world is in unity is when we connect to the same melodies. Music has the capacity to remove all of our bias and prejudices. In this sense, it can be regarded as a social tool. People who have no business speaking to each other instantly connect when they listen to music they both love.\n\nMusic Makes Learning Easy:\n\nThis has been validated throughout history. You probably remember the nursery rhymes you learned when you were a kid. Somehow, the music stays with us for longer periods of time. Even when we forget the words of a song, the melody never leaves. In addition to the above, music helps retain our mental focus.\n\nMusic Relaxes:\n\nThe importance of music would not be complete if we do not mention its therapeutic nature. Though some form of music can make us tense and anxious others help us reduce stress and anxiety. This is especially important due to the nature of the world we live in.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMusic is an important part of our lives. It dictates our mood, controls our thought and affects our relationship with others. Manâs history cannot be fully written without the impact of music on our lives.\n",

        "text": "Music Every Day:\n\nThe world is full of beautiful music and every culture and time in history has its special tune. The fact that we can listen to music every day is something I am grateful for deeply because it makes my life more beautiful. My favorite thing about music is the fact that you can find a tune that will suit almost any event or state of mind. Thankfully we are living in an age when this is becoming a fact, we can experience every day in various situations.\n\nMusic Makes you Happy:\n\nListening to music is not just pleasing esthetically but it also has many benefits for our mental well-being. Scientists have been talking about the positive influence music has on our brain and on the production of neural- transmitters like dopamine that gives us the feeling of satisfaction. The fact is that music is even used as part of some psychotherapy treatments and there is even evidence that it helps plants grow.\n\nMaking music can be considered one of our distinctive characteristics although singing is common in many animal species. That is why music has such a profound influence on our brain leading some to conclude that it is even part of our evolution and the reason we are humans. Music can be inspiring and it can comfort us in time of need, it is present when we celebrate something and also when we just want to make the dullness of everyday life go away. Music is one of our best friends and sometimes we do not give it the proper gratification, especially in the present age when it is so widespread and common.\n\nMusic as Identity:\n\nThe other major feature of the music is the fact that it is a strong marker of identity. Every ethnic group and nation have their own set of instruments and tunes they are well known for. When you think about Scotland you imagine the back pipes and the music they make, when you think about Germany there is the trumpet.\n\nThe wonderful thing about music and the instruments used to make it is the fact that it can be played by anyone and in many different locations. This has created so many variations of sound and styles that we can talk about an ocean of music or several oceans.\n\nThe 20th century has thought us many lessons about music and about the power world-renowned music artist can have over the public. Once this characteristic of music was discovered an army of producers sprung up to take control of that power and to divert it toward more materialistic goals. That has not changed the influence music tunes will have on our identity and the profound influence it has on our daily lives. Stopping and thinking about the influence it has on us makes my spine shiver as does the idea of a world without music. That is why I think we should support every person who wants to create music and make our lives more beautiful.",

        "text": "This review essay considers the relationships among opera, sound recording, and critical race theory, and explores them at a moment when these fields are beginning to converge. One of my concerns will be the recent and ground-breaking studies and collections on opera and race by Naomi Adele AndrÃ© (2017, 2019), Kira Thurman (2012, 2019), Pamela Karantonis and Dylan Robinson (2011), and Mary I. Ingraham, Joseph K. So and Roy Moodley (2016). Another will be the neglected history of opera and sound recording; notable scholars here include Karen Henson (2020), Robert Cannon (2014), and Richard Leppert (2015). Finally, I will focus on the thought-provoking analyses of race and sound by Alexander Weheliye (2005), Brian Ward (2003), Jennifer Lynn Stoever (2016) and Nina Sun Eidsheim (2019). There are obvious connections among these three bodies of scholarship, yet these connections have not yet been clearly identified and explored.\n\nAlthough many scholars have come to embrace opera as a material and embodied phenomenon, the artformâs dissemination, analysis, and enjoyment through sound recording is still overlooked as a site of enquiry, especially its potential as a fertile site of inquiry about identity. To overlook the issue of identity in relation to recording is to perpetuate the belief that recordings are primarily documents of performance practice. It ignores the army of technicians who invisibly craft the acoustic object, many of whom are historically white and male. This review essay seeks to address this neglect and to suggest some ways in which the processes of making and consuming opera recordings is intimately related to whiteness and anti-Blacknessâbut also to Black possibility. In what follows, I cast a broad net, ranging widely and at times unexpectedly. I begin with some recent events in American musicology and in the New York operatic scene; then, turn to a consideration of some of the scholarship just mentioned; and finally conclude with a brief discussion of a specific recording, the Metropolitan Operaâs âliveâ sound recording of the 2019 production of Gershwinâs Porgy and Bess.",

In fact, it allows us to connect to our inner self.\n\nStyles:\n\nThere are different styles of this art depending on different factors. Different countries have different styles of music of their own. Depending on the sounds, we have different forms of music such as pop, jazz, folk, Latin, classical, rock and many more.\n\nThe Power:\n\nMusic has that control, which can treat certain psychological sicknesses, for example, tension, not so ordinary energy or wretchedness. It is also the most amazing and supportive ways to treat the patient of a sleeping disorder. Additionally, it is the magnificent and invigorating force. We can contrast it with the motherâs affection. As the kid reliably needs the lap of his mother for overlooking everything and feels bliss. In a similar way, music serves to us as a mother to overlook each stress and tension in a melodic way.\n\nIt has the unwinding and recuperating power as well. Moreover, it encourages us to unwind, quiet our indignation down and furthermore to mend our stresses. We like to listen to different types of music, band or the vocalist and it changes from person to person. It encourages us to ruminate while doing Yoga and locate our more profound self by associating us to the otherworldly world.\n\nIt has No Barriers:\n\nOr more every one of these things, it knows no limits. Music does not differentiate between the general population, religion, station and belief. The conventional one is altogether different than the advanced, worldwide one. Today the universe of music has completely changed. We have such a large number of specialists, vocalists, artists, writers in the entire world making wonderful music. Today there are unique establishments, schools, and universities to learn this art expertly. Today students are seeking music as a profession, as a leisure activity and a vocation as well.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMusic is the essence of life. It has the power to heal people and can relieve you of your tensions. Moreover, it is always enjoyable to hear the type of music you love. People love listening to it whenever they find the time. It is an important subject in schools and a strong tool to promote culture as well. That is why perhaps music is so loved by one and all.\n",

Even musicologists often take this rhetorical route, arguing for the continued relevance of our work, for example by noting that studying music cultivates the kind of creative thinking skills that make workers attractive to corporations like Google. This way of promoting music and musicology thus reinforces the logic of state and capital by demonstrating musicâs usefulness within that logic. I argue that we should instead embrace and pedagogically center musicâs uselessness as its most potentially radical quality. Doing so could help us construct a new political imaginary that might more robustly resist the antisocial logics of capital.\n\nMy argument circles around the question of musical autonomy. While a certain version of autonomy undergirds our disciplineâs tools and assumptions, today this value is dismissed by almost everyone, including leftists and liberals, activists and academics. In salvaging the autonomous ideal, I attempt to resituate it firmly within collective practice, an orientation it has traditionally been seen as transcending. My exploration of collective autonomy weaves together work from musicology, political theory, anthropology, feminist theory, and Black studies, as well as from radical activist traditions that develop outside of any institutional framework. I think with and through these diverse perspectives, arguing that celebrating musicâs uselessness might aid our collective ability imagine a radically different world.",

Firstly, the tooth roller device of the residual film recovery machine is designed, and the main working parameters affecting the operation of the machine and the value range of each parameter are determined through the analysis of the operation process. Secondly, virtual simulation technology is used to establish a virtual simulation model of the interaction process between the tooth roller device and soil. At the same time, taking the soil-hilling quantity as the index, we build a quadratic regression mathematical model with three factorsâthe forward speed, rotation speed, and working depthâusing the BoxâBehnken method. Consequently, the analysis of the simulation results show that the order of the most significant factors is working depth, rotation speed, and forward speed. The optimal combination of working parameters are as follows: a forward speed of 4.5 km/h, a rotation speed of 43.2 r/min, and a working depth of 100.0 mm. Meanwhile, the predicted value of the soil-hilling quantity is 23.1 kg. Finally, we carried out field tests using the optimal combination parameters; the results show that the normal residual film collection rate is 66.8%, the soil-hilling quantity is 24.2 kg, and the relative error between the test value and the predicted value is 4.8%. This indicates that the devised DEM simulation model can be used to predict the operational performance of the tooth roller device in the working process. This study provides a reference that can be used in the planning and boundary enhancement of agricultural machinery and equipment.",

However, it is not clear if the differences among Nguni sheep are genetically distinct. The present study aimed to use the latest technology to assess the genetic relationship between Nguni sheep ecotypes and the relationship to other selected South African breeds using SNP markers. In the current study, 144 South African sheep samples (75 Nguni sheep and 69 mixed-breed sheep as a reference) were genotyped using the OvineSNP50 Bead Chip assay from Illumina. The Nguni consisted of 25 Pedi, 25 Swazi, and 25 Zulu sheep, with the reference group comprising 25 Namaqua, 23 Dorper, and 21 Damara sheep. After quality control of 54,241 SNPs, 48,429 SNPs remained for analysis (MAF > 0.05). There were genetic differences in the Nguni sheep population; notably, the Zulu and Swazi populations clustered together, but with a clear distinction from the Pedi ecotype. Genetic admixtures were detected in the Damara and Dorper sheep. This is most likely a consequence of recent intermixing between indigenous and commercial breeds. The levels of genetic diversity within individual types were generally lower compared to commercial breeds. This study revealed an understanding regarding genetic variation within and among indigenous sheep breeds, which can be used as baseline information for establishing conservation and breeding programmes",

The first year included two identical honeycomb design trials under ultra-low plant density (ULD) where the divergent selection was applied based on single plant yield and protein content. In the second year, progeny evaluation under typical crop density (TCD) for GY and PC occurred in a randomized complete block (RCB) and with three replications for each cultivar selected line. This revealed considerable variation within already improved commercial cultivars. Single-plant selection for GY and PC simultaneously resulted in: (a) one high-yielding line that significantly outperformed the original cultivar Svevo while maintaining high PC, and (b) two high-grain PC lines that outperformed the original cultivar Maestrale significantly while maintaining high GY. ULD allowed efficient selection for GY and PC simultaneously within narrow gene pools by maximizing phenotypic expression and differentiation among individual plants.",

A strict pot experiment was conducted for this purpose in a climatic chamber with a phytotron system and controlled temperature and air humidity. Maize seeds were planted and grown in soil with 20% (extreme drought), 40%, and 60% water holding capacity (WHC). The seeds were enhanced using proposed fertilizer and applied at a rate of 2 kg tâ1 seeds. The levels of ROS, as well as antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, and GPOX, generated by plants enhanced using the seed coating by fertilizer and by control specimens (non-enhanced), were measured 21 days after the seeds were planted. Antioxidant potential and total polyphenol contents in the plants were also determined. The findings show that under drought stress, plants produce high levels of ROS, which is responsible for oxidative stress. However, the latter phenomenon may be reduced using seed coating. Application of seed coating by fertilizer contributed to a 32.7% decrease in ROS in the case of extreme drought (soil with 20% WHC). The treatment also led to increased activity of SOD (61.2%), CAT (45.7%), and GPOX (35.8%), which shows its positive effects on activation of the enzymatic antioxidant system responsible for neutralization of ROS and for reducing the negative effects of drought",

The population structure for the three selected sites showed a type II curve, that is, mostly adults with few seedlings and juveniles. The spatial distribution presented an aggregate type pattern for the seedling and juvenile state categories, as well as a random type pattern for adults. The CPA allows us to visualize that there is a strong correlation between the chemical variables and the availability of some micronutrients; male individuals are the variable that explain the population structure. This shows that the low density of individuals in their early stages, together with the longevity of adult individuals and factors such as low rainfall, forest fires, reproductive biology and exploitation of the species put the persistence of populations at risk in this region.",

The omicron variant now accounts for 95.4% of genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in Africa, 96.0% in North America, and 87.6% in South America. This variant has been shown to escape antibody neutralization by both the BNT162b2 messenger RNA vaccine (PfizerâBioNTech) and the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Johnson & JohnsonâJanssen),1,2 which are the only two Covid-19 vaccines that have been administered in South Africa. We established the early effectiveness of the two-dose BNT162b2 vaccine regimen during the omicron-driven fourth wave in South Africa.2 The national vaccine program in South Africa has distributed 26,262,060 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and 8,477,267 doses of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. As of May 1, 44.8% of adults in South Africa had been fully vaccinated with two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine or a single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine. Assessing vaccine effectiveness is critical for national vaccine programs.\n\nStarting in October 2021, health care workers who were participating in phase 3b of the Sisonke study of the early vaccine access program3 were eligible to receive a second dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). Using data from Discovery Health, a South African managed care organization, we estimated the vaccine effectiveness of the original two-dose series of the BNT162b2 vaccine and a second (booster) dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine against severe Covid-19 caused by the omicron variant. Severe Covid-19 was defined as hospitalization or admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or to high care. (The latter refers to the practice of locating patientsâ beds close to the nursing station so that they can be observed 24 hours a day.) We analyzed data sets that included the results of polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assays to detect SARS-CoV-2, preauthorization admission data, a full history of membersâ claims records, chronic disease registrations, and data regarding body-mass index to assess individual risk factors.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of internal factors on floral coloration during the flowering period of four chrysanthemum cultivars of different colors. colorimetric measurements showed that L*, a*, and b* were in correlation with the lightness and color development in the four chrysanthemum cultivars. The distinctive shape of upper epidermal cells was observed in each flowering stage of different colored chrysanthemums. With progression of the flowering process, the content of anthocyanins and carotenoids increased during early stages, decreased at the senescence stage, and was the highest at the full-bloom stage. The vacuolar pH of flowers gradually decreased as the flower bloomed. Metal contents in flowers varied across different chrysanthemum varieties. Anthocyanins biosynthesis genes, such as CmCHS and CmCHI, were expressed and responsible for pigment changes in red chrysanthemums. Moreover, the expression pattern of cytosol pH-related genes, such as CmVHA-a1, CmVHA-C, and CmVHA-Câ³1, was in accordance with a decrease in pH during flowering stages.

As one of the most important human habitations and agricultural farming areas in arid areas, the Cele Oasis has a very developed agricultural system. This paper studies the long-term effects of different types of agricultural intensification strategies on groundwater level fluctuations in the Cele Oasis. A soil water flow (HYDRUS-1D) and aquifer simulation (MODFLOW) coupling model were used to construct the geometric structures of the vadose zone and saturated zone in the Cele Oasis and to analyze the recharge and discharge mechanism of the oasis. The results showed that HYDRUS-1D accurately simulated soil moisture transport in the Cele Oasis, providing reliable data for calibration of the MODFLOW model. The groundwater level simulated by MODFLOW was in good agreement with the observed value. The results of the R2, RMSE, and NSE were ranges of 0.77â0.90, 0.45â0.74 m, and 0.76â0.87, respectively. The errors were acceptable limits. The coupling model predicted the responses of different agricultural types and cropping scenarios to groundwater. Predictions showed that the groundwater level in the Cele Oasis remained stable under the current cropping scenario (100% cropping intensity), and that the groundwater level decreased slightly under the cropping scenario (110% cropping intensity and 130% cropping intensity). When the cropping scenario was at 170% cropping intensity, the groundwater level decreased rapidly, and the maximum drawdown value was 7 m. Therefore, the maximum cropping intensity of the Cele Oasis in the future should be 130% of the current cropping intensity",

Because stomatal conductance (gsw) is a comprehensive indicator of plants, soil moisture, and atmospheric conditions, this study used gsw to design a conceptual system by employing factors affecting gsw as the key for decision-making. Logistic regression was performed with independent variables (i.e., temperature (Tair), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and leafâair temperature difference) to predict the gsw status. When the gsw status was âlow,â the system entered into the environmental control component, which examined whether the VPD and the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) were in the normal range. If the VPD and the PPFD were not in the normal range, the system would offer a suggestion for environmental control. Conversely, when both parameters were in the normal range, the system would determine that irrigation should be performed and the irrigation amount could be estimated by the evapotranspiration model. Thus, the strategy only considered leaf temperature, Tair, VPD, and PPFD, and the overall error rate to characterize gsw was below 13.36%.",

Different countries and health care settings, as well as different subpopulations and age groups, may benefit from different vaccine products developed on different platforms. Efficacy and safety, as evaluated in phase 3 trials, are not the sole outcomes to be assessed in a countryâs decision to procure and introduce new Covid-19 vaccines. Ease of schedules, vaccine effectiveness when used in routine programs, need and frequency of boosters, cost, considerations regarding cold-chain logistics, manufacturing scalability, acceptability by communities, and scope for local or regional production are additional important factors.\n\nTo this end, we commend the development of two new vaccines, as now described in two articles in the Journal, one by Hager et al.4 and one by Dai et al.5 Both of these Covid-19 vaccines are produced on new technology platforms: Hager et al. describe a plant-based coronavirus-like particle vaccine, and Dai et al., a receptor-binding domain (RBD)âdimerâbased vaccine. Both vaccines have the advantage of not requiring extreme cold-chain procedures for storage, which makes them user-friendly in primary health care settings as well as in low- and middle-income countries, and it is important that such countries were included in the phase 3 trials of these vaccines. The time period of both trials covered the circulation of several SARS-CoV-2 variants, but the trials were completed before the emergence of the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant and subvariants.",

        "text": "We believe itâs essential that those of us in the medical community consider our collective responsibility to preserve the reproductive rights that have been legally in place in the United States since 1973, when Roe was decided. Some medical professionals have deeply entrenched views in support of or in opposition to abortion rights. Yet many of our colleagues persist in a muddled middle ground, feeling agnostic or ambivalent and watching the fractious abortion debates from the sidelines. Perhaps abortion care feels remote from their clinical specialties and irrelevant to the lives of their patients. We contend that it is not. The continued legal right to safe abortion is relevant to all of us, regardless of specialty, and to our family members, communities, and patients. The threat of losing this right calls for the engagement of the entire medical community. Abortion access is a critical component of reproductive justice,2 and an equitable and just society requires the existence of safe, affordable, and accessible abortion services.\n\nReproductive justice is the recognition of âthe human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities.â This framework was created by the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective and is built on a holistic view of reproductive opportunity and well-being. It emphasizes the importance of access not only to abortion but also to contraception, comprehensive sex education, adequate prenatal care, and other supports. Limitations on access to these resources contribute to unintended pregnancy and undermine bodily autonomy. The reproductive justice framework also recognizes that establishing a legal right to abortion isnât enough to ensure equitable access to abortion services throughout the United States.2 When practical access is restricted by arbitrary laws, gestational-age cutoffs, burdensome waiting periods, or geography, reproductive options are narrowed most substantially for populations that already have poor access to health care. Such barriers disproportionately affect people with inadequate health insurance coverage, people of color, and members of other marginalized groups.",

Data are needed regarding the effect of the fourth dose on rates of confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).\n\nMETHODS\nUsing the Israeli Ministry of Health database, we extracted data on 1,252,331 persons who were 60 years of age or older and eligible for the fourth dose during a period in which the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant of SARS-CoV-2 was predominant (January 10 through March 2, 2022). We estimated the rate of confirmed infection and severe Covid-19 as a function of time starting at 8 days after receipt of a fourth dose (four-dose groups) as compared with that among persons who had received only three doses (three-dose group) and among persons who had received a fourth dose 3 to 7 days earlier (internal control group). For the estimation of rates, we used quasi-Poisson regression with adjustment for age, sex, demographic group, and calendar day.\n\nRESULTS\nThe number of cases of severe Covid-19 per 100,000 person-days (unadjusted rate) was 1.5 in the aggregated four-dose groups, 3.9 in the three-dose group, and 4.2 in the internal control group. In the quasi-Poisson analysis, the adjusted rate of severe Covid-19 in the fourth week after receipt of the fourth dose was lower than that in the three-dose group by a factor of 3.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7 to 4.6) and was lower than that in the internal control group by a factor of 2.3 (95% CI, 1.7 to 3.3). Protection against severe illness did not wane during the 6 weeks after receipt of the fourth dose. The number of cases of confirmed infection per 100,000 person-days (unadjusted rate) was 177 in the aggregated four-dose groups, 361 in the three-dose group, and 388 in the internal control group. In the quasi-Poisson analysis, the adjusted rate of confirmed infection in the fourth week after receipt of the fourth dose was lower than that in the three-dose group by a factor of 2.0 (95% CI, 1.9 to 2.1) and was lower than that in the internal control group by a factor of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.7 to 1.9). However, this protection waned in later weeks.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRates of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe Covid-19 were lower after a fourth dose of BNT162b2 vaccine than after only three doses. Protection against confirmed infection appeared short-lived, whereas protection against severe illness did not wane during the study period.",

Seeking safety from escalating violence, most refugees have gone to the neighbouring countries of Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova. By far the largest number are in Poland, which as of 29 March 2022 had welcomed over 2 million refugees.1 This vulnerable population will have both immediate and long term healthcare needs.\n\nMartial law has prevented men aged 18-60 from leaving Ukraine so the vast majority of refugees are women, children, and older people. Many early refugees are staying with family or friends in host countries, but as the violence escalates, more refugees without connections are fleeing and require the most assistance.2 They often arrive cold and dehydrated, some having travelled for days. The harsh and overcrowded conditions endured during their journey and in reception centres make them susceptible to infectious diseases. Children are at particular risk of measles, polio, and other vaccine preventable diseases, including diarrheal diseases. Routine vaccination coverage in Ukraine was low before the war, and the rotavirus vaccine is not routinely given.34 Cramped conditions also make refugees vulnerable to covid-19. Before the war Ukraine had almost 25â000 new cases each day, with only 36% of the population fully vaccinated.5 As these diseases spread quickly in crowded settings, prevention measures including hygiene and masks, vaccination, and effective surveillance are priorities.",

Although a majority of HDAC inhibitors use hydroxamic acids as zinc binding groups, hydroxamic acid zinc-binding groups suffer from poor bioavailability and nonspecific metal-binding properties, necessitating a new zinc-binding group. Salicylic acid and its derivatives, well-known for their therapeutic value, have also been reported to chelate zinc ions in a bidentate fashion. This drew our attention towards replacing hydroxamic acid with salicylamide as a zinc-binding group.\n\nMethods: \nIn this study, for the first time, compound 5 possessing a novel salicylamide zinc-binding group was synthesized and evaluated biologically for its ability to inhibit various HDAC isoforms and induce acetylation upon Î±-tubulin and histone H3 among MDA-MB-231 cells.\n\nResults: \nCompound 5 exhibits selective inhibition against class I HDAC isoforms (HDAC1, 2, and 3) over class II and IV HDAC isoforms (HDAC4, 6, and 11). The exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to compound 5 efficiently induced the acetylation of more histone H3 than Î±-tubulin, suggesting that compound 5 is a class I selective HDAC inhibitor. Moreover, the molecular docking study indicated that the salicylamide zinc-binding group of compound 5 coordinates the active zinc ion of class I HDAC2 in a bidentate fashion.",

        "text": "The magic method?\nâWhatâs the best way to learn English, teacher?â This was probably one of the most frequently asked questions I was asked as an English teacher.\n\nAll students wanted to know the answer, regardless of their ability or context, from busy bankers in Santiago, Chile, to teenagers in the language centres in BogotÃ¡ and Phnom Penh, to kids in the summer language schools in the UK. They all wanted to know if there is a particularly effective method that would magically speed up the process of learning.\n\nThe answer was not always what the students were prepared to hear: it wasnât a set of prescribed grammar exercises they could complete, a clever mobile app they could use, or a pedagogically exceptional textbook they could work through. The answer was often met with disappointment as it was easier said than done: âIf you want to learn a language, you have to surround yourself with it and use it,â Iâd often say. âSpeak, listen, respond â communicate!â\n\nI was not recommending immersive communication as a method of learning just because I was trained in it during my CELTA or researched it for my MA in Applied Linguistics. I firmly stood behind this approach because Iâve lived through it. Growing up, my first two âforeignâ languages were learned in the countries where they were spoken and it was not until I went to an international university where English was unavoidable that I truly mastered that language as well.\n\nWhat does the research tell us?\nThere are numerous studies that show that students who are exposed to the language theyâre learning in an immersive way, be it through a bilingual immersion programme at their school or a study-abroad experience, exhibit higher levels of fluency (e.g. Cummins 2009, Kinginger 2011, Wilkinson 1998), particularly when motivation to learn and absorb the language is high. The high motivation, in turn, is fostered by the desire to belong to or approximate the culture of the target language.\n\nWe are wired to desire emotional and social connection, and when placed in contexts where such connection is only available through a foreign language, our motivation to acquire it increases. This is why learning a language in the country where it is spoken is so effective â it offers an opportunity for complete language immersion. Lots of communicative language lessons aim to mimic such immersion through meaningful context, extensive second language (L2) input and emotional engagement.\n\nWhile immersive language experiences are effective in students of all ages, they can bear remarkable results in children. In second language acquisition research, there is something called âthe critical period hypothesisâ (CPH). It holds that all humans have a period (usually at a young age) during which it is possible to achieve full native competence when learning a language in a linguistically rich, immersive environment â something that has not been observed with adults.\n\nCPH is not universally accepted and has been contested (e.g. Vanhove 2013). There are numerous studies that support the notion that children are known to be more open to learning a language intuitively, through communication, rather than through learning a set of strict rules, and that early language exposure sets learners up for success and confidence later in life (e.g. Abrahamsson and Hyltenstam 2009, Birdsong 2009, DeKeyser 2012).\n\nHow can we create immersive experiences?\nNot everyone has the opportunity to travel or study abroad for extensive periods of time in order to brush up on their English. Luckily, we live in a world where the merge of globalisation and digitalisation has produced many opportunities for learners to be exposed to English in a variety of contexts. These include, but are not limited to:\n\nwatching films and videos\nlistening to songs\ncommenting on online videos\nengaging in online discussions\nattending webinars and online courses in English\nplaying video games!\nThis last point is something that we are exploring with English Adventures with Cambridge â our new Minecraft world. Designed specifically with young learners in mind (ages 8â11), it boasts a linguistically rich environment built using the vocabulary and structures accessible for learners at A1âA2 levels of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).\n\nIt provides learners with an opportunity to interact with the language that is accessible at their level in an authentic way. Misunderstood or missed something? Not a problem! Just like in real life, a misunderstanding will lead to opportunities for clarification in context, which, coupled with the emotional engagement fostered by the narrative, creates authentic learning experiences.\n\nImmerse your child in our Minecraft world!\nEnglish Adventures with Cambridge is our exciting new world created by world-leading English assessment experts in collaboration with Minecraft.

        "text": "There are five broadly defined prerequisites for effective learning: meaningful context, authenticity, motivation, freedom to make mistakes, and learner autonomy. Cambridge English teaching and learning materials harness the power of meaningful context and authenticity by presenting new language in a way that creates a genuine need to interact and communicate. And, as all teachers would attest, learners are most successful when they are motivated, free to learn from their mistakes, and take ownership of their own learning process.\n\nSo what do video games have to do with this? Well, in addition to the known benefits of games, video games support each of the building blocks of effective learning by providing:\n\na strong and engaging narrative (context)\npurposeful interactions (authenticity)\nemotional engagement (motivation)\nfreedom to fail (mistakes)\nopportunities for independent decision making (learner autonomy).\nContext â A strong narrative\nContext is the glue that helps us connect new information to what we already know about the world. This is why when we learn a language, we cover a series of topics like family, hobbies or holidays, instead of learning all of the words in the order that they appear in a dictionary starting with A and ending with Z. Without appropriate context, new information has nothing to attach itself to in our brain and becomes almost impossible to remember.\n\nVideo games set excellent context by providing a strong and engaging narrative, a story. Humans are wired to connect with stories. A strong narrative is compelling because it triggers an emotional response, which in turn makes it memorable. Thatâs why storytelling is such a powerful tool in marketing, politics, business and media. When teaching young learners, storytelling is vital: children rely on episodic memory much more than adults â remembering concrete facts and events they experienced that are linked together in learning.\n\nVideo games in general, and Adventures in English with Cambridge in particular, provide a strong and engaging narrative in which the player is intrinsically motivated to participate. How could they not be when theyâre placed in the centre as the main protagonist? âSomeoneâs destroying my library, help me!â pleads Lilac, âThe stories need fixing, too!â\n\nScreenshot of Minecraft game play, featuring Lilao who explains that the user is their new assistant\nAuthenticity â Purposeful interactions\nWe all know that being able to use the second language (L2) is more important than knowing facts about it. How often would you have to explain to a waiter in a foreign country which part of speech you are about to use when ordering a cup of coffee? Never â what matters is communication and meaning! âIâd like a cup of coffee, please,â when sitting down at a table in a cafÃ©. You wouldnât expect the waiter to then reply, âWell done, that was the correct use of âwouldâ!â This is because in real life, we speak or write or read or listen when we have a need or a reason to do so â we call this âintrinsic motivationâ.\n\nVideo games provide similar intrinsic motivation to communicate in a meaningful context. In our language-learning experience in Adventures in English with Cambridge , for example, the player will interact with Lilac, a fairy librarian in a giant library. âIâm thirsty! Can you bring me a hot drink?â Lilac asks. To fulfil her request, the player will not need to complete a classroom-like vocabulary task. Instead, by exploring the beautiful library, the player will find a fully functional vending machine. Just like in real life, âmilkshakeâ, âjuiceâ and âlemonadeâ will be available for purchase, but the player will only hear the librarian say, âAh, finally! It was delicious, thank you!â when they bring her back a cup of coffee, rewarding the player with some more authentic language used in context.\n\nScreenshot of Minecraft game play, featuring Lilao who says 'Yay, sweet caffeine' \nMotivation â Emotional engagement\nThereâs a direct link between learner motivation and learning outcomes in and outside the classroom. Engaged learners are focused and curious, and generally do better than those who are disinterested or distracted. Video games are very good at leveraging the story, the challenges and the rewards within the game to trigger emotional response which is directly linked to motivation.\n\nInside our game in Minecraft, learners are motivated to solve the language puzzles because it ensures their progress within the game. Theyâre encouraged to persevere in their learning, both by the environment and the characters they meet. Players can choose which parts to pay most attention to, but they canât avoid it. The language is built into the interactions within the game. To progress, players have no choice but to communicate â¦ in English!\n\nScreenshot of Minecraft game play, featuring Charlie who won't let the user get passed, giving the user a choice in how to proceed\nMistakes help you learn â Freedom to fail\nIt might seem counter-intuitive, but when learning a language, mistakes can be beneficial when learners are given an opportunity to notice and reflect on them in a safe environment. Video games are excellent at providing plenty of safe opportunities to practise. In our Minecraft game, for example, players are free to wander off the wrong way or spell a word wrong. Instead of losing marks or progress, each mistake will result in more language input, to nudge learners towards the solution. This freedom to fail in video games is key to uninhibited language practice and is fundamental to our Adventures in English with Cambridge.\n\nAutonomy â Independent decision making\nFinally, in all kinds of teaching contexts, learner autonomy is another pillar of success. The more engaged the learner is in their own learning process, the more fruitful the results. In language-learning classrooms, learners are encouraged to develop study skills alongside listening, writing, speaking and reading â keeping consistent vocabulary notes, drawing mind maps, developing strategies for exam taking, listening and expeditious reading, to name just a few.\n\nIn video games, the process of becoming an independent decision maker is naturally fostered through the nature of the task in hand: the player has to discover ways out of tricky situations, frequently coming back to the starting point and starting all over again in order to progress within the game. In doing so, the players not only develop their sense of curiosity, but also perseverance, problem-solving skills and confidence, the usefulness of which stretches back to the classroom and beyond.",

Ethical dimensions of recent technological developments, such as DNA engineering, have become a focal point of questioning and discussion. Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it.\n\nTo make matters worse, a consensus definition of technology has become more difficult to find due to recent evolution in science and its applications.

According to Aristotle, the former have their principles of generation and motion inside, whereas the latter, insofar as they are artifacts, are generated only by outward causes. For example, animals, which are natural things, can grow, move, and reproduce. A wooden bed, which is an artifact made by a human, cannot move, grow, or reproduce itself.",

        "text": "'You know,' said one of my students to me. 'Mega sad face.'\n\nThe fact that I could barely understand a student of mine, who's usually quite articulate, got me thinking about communication and the years to come. \n\nWe all think we communicate all the time, and that's true. There's also non-verbal communication you could add into the mix - everything we're saying when we're not saying anything. But there's a fine line between saying things to people, or liking and sharing a post on social media, and communication. I'm quite well connected - there's Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, email, iEverything(!), but sometimes communication starts to feel like a chore. Check this blog post, read that article someone shared, text back to someone else and answer their question ... Sometimes I feel like a cross between Siri and a mad juggler. Nothing seems to go in and I'm always mixing people up - asking someone how their band is going when they can't play an instrument or how the job search is going when someone's just written to say how depressed they are that they can't find a job. \n\nSo it was quite a shock to spend New Year in the Highlands in Scotland with no phone signal, no internet and no 'communication' at all, apart from with the people I was with. Suddenly all the pressure to communicate disappeared. All of our conversations became slower, more inverted and far more interesting. We were a group of 12, a mixture of couples and friends, only one of whom I was at university with, so I was meeting a bunch of new people for the first time. Our conversations veered towards the banal and the humdrum in that we often discussed our plans for the day and what we were going to cook in the evening, but often they went a lot farther and a lot deeper. Tucked up on the leather sofas, digesting dinner, we dissected Brexit and one person even changed their perspective entirely! We shared ideas and theories, plots of books and plays and city trips we'd been on, described family troubles and gave advice, listened to work scenarios and offered pointers, and we had to talk and sketch and use words more than ever before, because you couldn't say, 'It's a great film, you should google it later.' Some of us even had sore throats from talking so much! In such a short space of time, due to the proximity of sharing interconnected cottages and verbal communication, I felt much closer to the new people I'd met and been speaking with than some other people I communicate with in my normal life. \n\nI don't think our common, current methods of communication come close to being in a small house with lots of people and having to communicate live. The brevity of Twitter, the showiness of Facebook, all these aspects contribute to a shallow form of communication that doesn't challenge you to examine your feelings and motives enough. 'Liking' something is an instant response but what does it really say about your opinion of something? It's an identical response to millions of other people, whereas you and your thoughts are unique. If we're not careful, perhaps we might forget how to communicate on a deeper level.\n\nAnd what did my student mean? Were they distraught? Panicked? Melancholic? I'll never know. ",

The headache caused by your phone beeping and vibrating 24/7? Being contactable whenever and wherever you are?\n\nDonât get me wrong, Iâd find it really difficult to be sociable without social media. It would be extremely hard to keep in contact with friends and family, especially if they live far away. Organising meet-ups would be a nightmare â imagine having to set a date in writing or in person, weeks in advance. What would happen if you were running late? You wouldnât even be able to ping your friends a text to let them know. Events on Facebook and WhatsApp group messages have made organising everything so easy. Theyâve enabled spontaneity â if itâs a sunny day, why not go for a picnic in the park? Without notifications about the weather, an app for maps on your phone or a Facebook group message to invite your friends and decide who should bring strawberries and who should bring crisps, where would we be? Stuck at home, wishing weâd predicted good weather today when we last saw our friends in person.\n\nBut I find social media stressful. If youâre not checking your phone at least every half an hour, you might miss out on something important or fun. If you donât message that friend you havenât seen in a while, they might think youâve forgotten about them. If you donât remember to shower your bestie with ugly selfies, you might not keep up that Snapchat streak!\n\nIf youâre meant to be doing homework, can you resist the temptation to check why your phone is flashing? If you have friends round and thereâs a lull in conversation, are you tempted to tap out a quick reply to your friend on the other end of the internet rather than playing a game with your friends on the sofa next to you?\n\nIn the 21st century contact is quicker and easier, but that doesnât mean we have more free time. If anything, the opposite. The ability to send a quick message to one friend means we have time to send one to five others, and before you know it youâre having five conversations at once. How can you really concentrate on any of them? And if your Twitter or Instagram feed is buzzing, why bother going outside to kick a football about or signing up for music lessons? Youâre entertained enough â you just never have time to relax, let off steam, enjoy the world. Try leaving your phone at home and doing something productive, maybe even alone, today â you might feel all the better for it.",

        "text": "Have you ever seen a car without a driver? It sounds crazy, but these computer-driven driverless cars will soon be filling roads near you. Companies like Google and Tesla have been designing and testing these cars, and the technology is there â they just need to see if theyâre value for money, work out insurance issues, and run final tests to check they can run alongside human-driven cars on the road.\n\nSo how do they work? The cars have sensors all around which can detect other cars and obstacles in the road. Sensors on the wheels also help when parking, so the car knows how far it is from the kerb or other parked cars. Road signs are read by cameras, and satellite navigation systems are used so the car knows how to get to your destination. All you have to do is type in the address! Finally, a central computer system takes in all the information it receives from the sensors and cameras and processes this to work out when to accelerate, brake and steer.\n\nSound like your idea of heaven? Sitting back, looking out of the windows and even watching a film or reading a book while âdrivingâ would be possible with this new technology. You wouldnât have to worry about remembering directions to where youâre going. In addition, computers are generally more efficient drivers than humans, meaning emissions would be reduced. They would also drive more safely than people â they donât get distracted by music or friends, they would obey the speed limit and they have quicker reaction times in case of an emergency.\n\nHowever, there are many drawbacks of driverless cars. Computers would have difficulties making ethical decisions; if a child ran into the road, would the computer choose to hit the child or swerve and potentially kill the carâs passengers? Moreover, I personally find driving fun â Iâd miss never being behind the wheel myself. There would also be many legal decisions to be made â should children, or drunk people, be allowed in a driverless car by themselves? Or would there need to be a responsible adult with a driving licence in the car at all times?\n\nAlthough being driven around by a machine would perhaps mean that no one needs a driving licence, saving money for everyone, many people would be put out of a job by the dawn of driverless cars. Bus, taxi, train and tram drivers as well as driving instructors would be made redundant.\n\nIâm not convinced Iâd want a driverless car â but itâs only a matter of time before theyâll become more affordable and commonplace on our roads.",

        "text": "Breweries, cheese-making factories, paper mills, distilleries â¦ we are inquisitive and we pay lots of money to visit these factories and find out how things are made.\n\nThere was a temporary exhibition on in the south of Spain which exhibited everyday items such as the paperclip, an umbrella, Lego bricks, resealable plastic bags, pencils and tin cans used for storing food or drink. The exhibition told you when these items were first created, discussed their uses and showed how they were made in short films. It also told you who invented them and why.\n\nHave you ever wondered how things are made? Do you know how newspapers are printed or how marbles are created? How do factories create windscreens for cars? How is the detail added? How are the machines so precise and how is the glass so clear?\n\nThereâs a programme on television in England at the moment called How things are made. Each programme is between 20 and 30 minutes in length, and they are fascinating as they give you a perfect insight into how everyday objects are created.  \n\nDid you know that a Chinese man, Cai Lun, invented paper in AD 50? It was called âpapyrusâ by the Romans and bore very little resemblance to the âpaper-thinâ paper we have nowadays â and we are using recycled paper now too! You can watch how recycled paper is remade into paper here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c8YxMb0tlk\n\nItâs really interesting to see how things are produced. We often take everything for granted and rarely sit down and wonder at the amount of effort that goes into designing everyday items. Some things, such as suits, still require human input into making them, although not for every stage, and marbles require a large amount of human involvement. Other objects such as snooker cues are entirely dependent on the precision of machines designing, moulding and creating each individual element.\n\nItâs amazing how quick machines make the manufacturing process, but is it good for everything to be manufactured by machines? Humans are costly, as they have to be paid, but films such as I Robot show the dangers of becoming too dependent on machines and robots. Plus, the skills which people used to have to make various objects are being lost, because they are skill sets which are outdated and now no longer required.",

        "text": "In one of my classes today we discussed the question of how our lives would be without a phone and I actually felt quite sad to hear how some kids these days cannot survive without their mobiles. Personally, I think nowadays we are controlled by our technology and pressurised to keep up. So let's see some of the points that came up in the debate and see if our generation really is addicted to electronic connections rather than true communication.\n\nIt is true that everything works at a fast pace these days, due to the quick access we have to pretty much anything and anyone. For example, you can contact someone who lives on the other side of the world within seconds. This is great if you think about how connected we can stay to the people who are far away from us; however, on the contrary, can we be too connected to the people who are close to us? An argument arose about the fact that it is easier to message someone from your sofa than to meet them in person and talk. On one hand, it is easier and nice sometimes to casually chat to a friend this way. However, it is also lazier and rude to prefer to talk to someone on your phone rather than meeting up, if you are able to, in my opinion. Social skills are important to have and if you are not going to put effort into real-life communication, then you are not going to progress in this ability.\n\nAnother point was that phones are very handy to look up something that you are wondering about. For example, if you don't know a word in another language, you can quickly and simply access a translator to help you out. This can be very helpful in many situations, but it can also make a person dependent on the internet to help with anything. This factor slightly takes away the diversity of learning a language and conversing with people, as you are able to access everything you need via the web. \n\nAll in all, this question is very interesting to consider for oneself as we become day by day more dependent on technology. We should just be aware of how much we really need to be connected via our phones while considering the benefits and damage it can cause us.",

Although sometimes this doesnât work, if you search it and click the first result on the page, it will take you back to the homepage which will then fall.

It will, however, cause all of the results to fall from the sky and crash down on top of the already fallen homepage.\n\nFinally, my favourite. Type 'Zerg Rush' into the search bar and hit enter.

We have become addicted to our smartphones.\n\nOf course, smartphones are undeniably useful and have revolutionised our lives in so many ways. Thanks to thousands of apps available to download, we're now able to do almost anything when we're out and about. However, it seems a shame that these addictive pieces of technology are slowly beginning to take over our lives. It's so easy to become dependant on our phones, whether it's to find your way around with the map application or even just check the time. As a result we're becoming more anti-social, choosing to consult the internet rather than talk face-to-face with other human beings.\n\nEven when we're socialising, it seems most of us struggle without our phones at arm's reach. Phones were invented to keep us more connected, and indeed they have done just that. We can now get in contact by an endless list of social media outlets, yet this means we're starting to lack genuine contact with each other. People are connecting more and more across screens rather than in person, even when it comes to relationships - dating apps and websites are more popular than ever before. Recently, an artist released a series of images depicting people in social situations and edited out their smartphones and tablets. The result was a collection of powerful images that have, perhaps ironically, gone viral. They force people to wake up to the fact that we are no longer interacting properly with each other.\n\nI'm not to say I'm any better (as I write this my phone is sitting across from me at my desk). However, I'm trying to use it less and less when I'm out and about. When I first arrived in France I didn't have any internet on my phone and it was actually quite liberating. Rather than constantly checking my phone for messages or searching for directions, I was forced to talk to people and find my way around independently. Next time you're out with your friends, put your phone away and see how long you can last without it.",

The lights had gone out, the oven had stopped working and my phone was no longer charging. My flatmates and I tried to fix it but we soon realised that we couldnât. We would have to wait for an electrician to come in the morning. This left me a whole night without any electricity. After messaging my friends and family to say that I wouldnât be able to message tonight because I couldnât charge my phone, I sat down to eat my half-cooked dinner. And then I wasnât really sure what to do. My typical evening is spent watching the TV and scrolling through social media. Tonight this wasnât possible. Due to the lack of lights I couldnât even read a book. We werenât prepared with candles and matches. Weâre just so reliant on electricity, and expectant that it will work.\n\nSo for me it was an early night. And I couldnât help but think, do we rely too much on electricity? That night, losing our electricity felt like losing a basic necessity. As basic as running water. But really, electricity is a luxury that weâve grown to take for granted. I use electricity all the time, even when itâs not really necessary. I use it to put the TV on in the background even when Iâm not really watching it. I use it to check my phone when I have to wait for even just a minute, for example when waiting for friends. And as Iâm writing this, I have my lights on, even in the middle of the day when I donât really need them.\n\nOur over-use of electricity is a big problem. It contributes to global warming, which is something that we really should be worried about. It is harming our environment and we need to do what we can to stop it. Not only that, but if we continue to use the same large amount of energy we will soon run out.\n\nHow would we survive in a world without electricity? Our daily lives revolve around it. We wouldnât be able to function. Yet we know that, one day, we will run out. So, shouldnât we start preparing for it now? Cutting back on our use of electricity would make losing it easier, and also save energy resources so that they could last for longer. I know for sure that I could cut down on my use of electricity. And if everyone does the same, we can make a big difference.",

It's also called the Terracotta Warriors and Horses and they were found by farmers digging for a well on the outskirts of Xiâan in 1974. Becoming a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987, the spectacular figures continue to attract millions of visitors from all over the world. Yet the excavations are unfinished. Famously, archaeological work at the site and the accompanying Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor has been allowed to slow down until technology advances enough to preserve the artefacts currently buried underground. In addition to this, safety concerns have been raised regarding the unusually high levels of mercury found on the soil. Allegedly this is from the mercury streams which were inlaid in the floor of the burial chamber, but only time will tell if this ancient tale is true.\n\nCurrently 8000 soldiers have been found, each one with a distinctively different look. This was achieved through an early use of assembly-line-type construction. The warriors were assembled using moulds, with 8 different heads to choose from, and features being added with additional clay by skilled craftsmen. Studying the warriors and their horses offers historians an important insight into this period in Chinese history. The technology used to assemble the underground army was truly remarkable. Over 40,000 bronze weapons were found, and after more than 2000 years they still appear sharp. How is this possible? The ancient Chinese managed to use protective chrome plating, something which was thought to have been invented in Germany in 1937! Chinese metallurgy was thousands of years ahead of its time.\n\nWhen it is finally uncovered, the sight will truly be spectacular and much more will be understood about Chinaâs first Emperor and the level of technology the ancient Chinese possessed.",

If you look up, you'll see cameras on many street corners, at bus stops, on trains and even in some public toilets. We seem to have developed an obsession with them!\n\nIn 2013, an article published in The Guardian (a British newspaper) stated that there was 1 camera for every 11 people in Britain. There are estimated to be around 6 million CCTV cameras across Britain - now that's a lot of cameras! Thanks to our apparent love of CCTV, Britain has been nicknamed the \"surveillance state\".\n\nCCTV is a vital tool for the police and can help solve crimes - a notable example would be the James Bulger case from 1993. CCTV images meant that the two boys who committed the crime were caught and prosecuted. However, CCTV does not always have all the answers. Sometimes the images aren't clear enough to identify people; often, criminals obscure their faces to avoid being caught. Recently, some talking CCTV cameras have been installed in the UK. These react to movement, and warn criminals that their photo has been taken. \n\nIn my opinion, CCTV has gone too far. As a nation, we rely on it far too much. At what point did we decide to replace police officers with technology? Many people claim to feel safer as a result of CCTV; if more police were around I'm sure they'd feel just as safe! Many schools across Britain have installed CCTV - in classrooms, toilets and changing rooms. They say it helps to prevent bullying - but surely something else could be done instead? ",

With the sudden rise of social networks over the last decade, we are now able to create our own online identities through the forms of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Blogger, Pinterest ... the list goes on. At the touch of a button we're able to share photos, videos and our thoughts and feelings with friends and followers all over the world. It has become a platform to share all the positives in our lives, a way to show off, for example when we go on holiday. Our culture has become obsessed with counting the number of 'likes' we get on a photo or how many 'favourites' we get on a tweet. It's easy to look at someone on social media and consider them to have the perfect life, however in many cases there is another story behind the filtered selfies.\n\nAn Australian 'Instagram celebrity' called Essena O'Neill recently made headlines after she decided to quit social media. Despite having over half a million Instagram followers she revealed her pictures were all completely fake and had been set up. She explained she was often paid by companies to post photos and would take hundreds of selfies before posting what appeared to be a candid shot.\n\nSocial media can also often make us feel isolated, since we only ever see one side of a person's life. You will rarely see someone post to say they are watching TV on their own or studying for an exam, whereas it's normal to see people out socialising with friends. It's easy to assume all our friends are having an amazing time all the time, but remember to take what you see on social media with a pinch of salt; someone's online presence may not be all it's cracked up to be.",

However, increasingly scientists are saying that we need to give ourselves a break - otherwise we put ourselves at risk of developing hundreds of health problems. Over the summer the days are longer, sunnier and free from school. With all this free time, why not put it to good use and do something that doesn't involve technology?\n\nTo start with, you could learn a new skill. There are hundreds of possibilities: crafts, cooking, learning a musical instrument or a new sport. Maybe you've always wanted to try out that recipe, but haven't had time? Perhaps you fancy learning how to knit, so you can have a new jumper for the autumn? You could use your free time to learn something new - and perhaps it'll lead to an exciting opportunity in the future.\n\nIf you just fancy relaxing, why not head to a beach? Take along your favourite book and relax on the sand, or go for a stroll along the coastline (just make sure you're aware of the tides!). If you don't live near a beach, you could go to your local park. Why not take along a picnic, or try and identify some of the local wildlife?\n\nLittle things, like challenging yourself to complete a crossword or a Sudoku, are a great place to start. You could even get involved in the latest craze: adult colouring books! Colouring is surprisingly therapeutic, and it can be a nice way to escape from the stress of modern life!\n\nWhatever you choose to do with your summer, try something new! You might surprise yourself and find a hidden talent within you; you might make new friends along the way. Next time you find yourself aimlessly channel-hopping, have a think at what else you could spend your time doing.",

        "text": "Lots of us have smartphones these days. Smartphones are quite amazing, as one device can do so many things. During my time abroad Iâve relied a lot on my phone to help me. Here are the ten most useful apps I have used. Iâve never paid for an app, so you can rest assured the ones Iâve listed here are totally free!\n\nCalendar\nAll phones come with an inbuilt calendar app. Iâve found myself using the app quite a lot recently. It is important to know your dates when planning a weekend away. It is also comforting to check the app when Iâm feeling homesick â it helps to remind me that I will be home soon, so I should make the most of my time abroad.\n\nFacebook\nYou wonât be surprised to find Facebook on this list! As Iâm sure you know, itâs an essential for staying in touch with friends. Itâs also been the easiest way for me to contact the other language assistants in my town.\n\nGoogle Translate\nItâs that moment when the word is on the tip of your tongue, but you just canât remember! Donât worry, Google Translate can lend a hand! Just make sure you double-check if you are translating longer texts, as the software does make some very humorous mistakes!\n\nGmail\nPersonally, I really like the Gmail app because it automatically sorts email into different categories. The important mail goes straight to my inbox, while less important mail is sorted into other categories. Of course, it doesnât really matter which email provider you use! The email app has been essential to contact my schools and keep in touch with family back home.\n\nHeadspace\nAfter an exhausting day of work, I needed a way to help calm and focus my mind. This is how I found Headspace. Sign up for free to try some easy meditations - they only take ten minutes. Iâve found them a great way to relax after a stressful day.\n\nTemple Run\nTake the idol if you dare! You assume the role of an explorer, who steals a sacred artefact form a jungle temple and is chased by evil demon monkeys. Use the touchscreen to jump and duck while collecting coins. An addictive way to kill spare time!\n\nTinyScan\nThere have been several times when Iâve had to send scans of my documents to various authorities in France. But I could hardly fit a whole scanner in my suitcase! Fortunately, I didnât need to. TinyScan uses your smartphoneâs camera to create a scan of a document, which you can email to yourself or others. Itâs been a lifesaver!\n\nTripAdvisor\nWhen exploring a new town, itâs good to know the best places to eat and the most interesting attractions to see. I always turn to TripAdvisor for information. Here, you can find hotels, restaurants and attractions listed with other visitors' ratings and comments. It makes it a lot easier to choose a good hotel.\n\nTumblr\nTumblr is a blogging site which specialises in image posts. There are plenty of blogs to choose from, covering subjects from cartoons to geology. Follow a few blogs you like and you can easily spend half an hour (or more!) scrolling through your newsfeed (âtumblringâ, as itâs called). You can re-blog the posts you like to share them with your friends. A great distraction if youâre feeling bored!\n\nWunderlist\nDo you find your head cluttered with things you need to do? Shopping, preparation for school work and social engagements have given me lots of things to remember recently. Every time an idea pops into my head, I tap the Wunderlist app. Itâs a very easy place to write down things I need to do. Ideas can be sorted into different categories and shared with others. You can also add reminders so you wonât forget anything, and sync your lists with your computer.\n",

        "text": "For those of you who havenât heard of it, the Apple watch is the latest invention from the infamous creators of the iPhone and Apple Mac. As the name suggests, this creation is a device designed to tell us the time. This is Apple, however, and an Apple watch is never just a watch. In fact, this accessory is multifunctional; not only does it show us the time, but it also acts as a fitness monitor and a messaging device that can be connected with an iPhone.\n\nIs this a genius invention or technology gone too far?\n\nWhilst the upcoming Apple watch is stylish in appearance, I canât help but question certain aspects of the new device. Is it a positive thing to be able to receive messages through a watch, or is this another way of letting technology disrupt our social lives?\n\nThanks to the invention of the smartwatch, we will no longer have to reach for our phones to check our messages. Imagine the possible consequences. A group of friends sitting at a table in a restaurant will ignore each other as everyone will be too busy watching their wrists in anticipation of a new message. Students will have a means of âdiscreetlyâ checking their inbox during school, despite the fact that mobile phones are forbidden in class. The list goes on. Although smartwatches may make communicating through technology easier, it seems that it could actually hinder face-to-face communication.\n\nMuch like a phone, the watch would also need to be charged every day. This is yet another aspect of the device which sets it apart from any ânormalâ watch. If, like me, you struggle when remembering to put your phone on charge, this is not necessarily a positive thing.\n\nI do have to agree, however, the watch has some interesting and purposeful functions. As a fitness monitor, the device can be used to create and record sporting activities. This could be of particular interest to sports fans. Whilst there are several existing android apps that can already do this, I can see that the Apple watch would be a more convenient way of exercising without a mobile phone. The questions remains, however, is the price worth the benefits?\n\nWhilst there are clearly both positive and negative aspects when it comes to Appleâs latest invention, I personally like my single-purpose watch that simply tells me the time! What about you? Would you be interested in having a smartwatch?",

        "text": "Bitcoin.\n\nIt's everywhere in the news at the moment. It comes with myriad (lots of) warnings from technology and economics experts, who see investment in it as dangerous and insecure. Each Bitcoin is currently worth over $14,000 (at the time of writing). That's a lot of money.\n\nBut, what actually is it? Unless you work or invest in Bitcoin, most normal people have no idea what it is or how it works. Iâm going to try and explain the basics of Bitcoin in the simplest way possible.\n\nBitcoin is the most famous type of cryptocurrency. A cryptocurrency is a currency, like a British Pound (Â£) or a United States Dollar ($), but that only exists online, in digital form. A cryptocurrency is independent of any national or international (central) bank, and so cannot be affected by the economic policies of any country.\n\nOK, this is the technical part ... cryptocurrencies work by using âblockchainâ technology. This technology involves a network of public computers that all have access to a digital record book that records all of the transactions that have been made in the cryptocurrency between people online. Normal members of the public, like you or me, have access to the âbookâ. Therefore, it is normal people (called âminersâ) who make sure that all transactions are correct and legal, instead of a central bank. These âminersâ earn rewards for making sure that the cryptocurrency is transferred correctly.\n\nAs a result, making transfers in Bitcoin is almost free, and no personal information is recorded with each transaction. Bitcoin is almost completely untraceable, and therefore anonymous.\n\nRecently, it has become more mainstream as more and more people have invested in the currency. In addition, more companies are offering services that can be paid for in Bitcoin. Its value has therefore increased dramatically â one Bitcoin was worth $750 at the beginning of 2017, and is now worth over $14,000.\n\nPhew. It is complicated, and this blog is brief, but as Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies get more and more popular, they are having a bigger impact on the global economy. There are several very useful YouTube videos that explain the concept of Bitcoin very well, and in a lot more depth than this blog. My personal favourite is by a channel called âSciShowâ.",

Curiosity was awakened; a desire to trade with wealthy Asian cultures motivated a renewed interest in exploring the world. The period of time between the 15th and 17th centuries is known in the West as the Age of Exploration or the Age of Discovery.\n\nWith the dawn of the Age of Discovery, the study of geography regained popularity in Europe. The invention of the printing press in the mid-1400s helped spread geographic knowledge by making maps and charts widely available. Improvements in shipbuilding and navigation facilitated more exploring, greatly improving the accuracy of maps and geographic information. \n\nGreater geographic understanding allowed European powers to extend their global influence. During the Age of Discovery, European nations established colonies around the world. Improved transportation, communication, and navigational technology allowed countries such as the United Kingdom to successfully govern colonies as far away as the Americas, Asia, Australia, and Africa.\n\n\nGeography was not just a subject that made colonialism possible, however. It also helped people understand the planet on which they lived. Not surprisingly, geography became an important focus of study in schools and universities. \n\nGeography also became an important part of other academic disciplines, such as chemistry, economics, and philosophy. In fact, every academic subject has some geographic connection. Chemists study where certain chemical elements, such as gold or silver, can be found. Economists examine which nations trade with other nations, and what resources are exchanged. Philosophers analyze the responsibility people have to take care of the Earth.",

Throughout human history, most societies have sought to understand something about their place in the world, and the people and environments around them. \n\nIndeed, mapmaking probably came even before writing in many places. But ancient Greek geographers were particularly influential. They developed very detailed maps of areas in and around Greece, including parts of Europe, Africa, and Asia. More importantly, they also raised questions about how and why different human and natural patterns came into being on Earthâs surface, and why variations existed from place to place. The effort to answer these questions about patterns and distribution led them to figure out that the world was round, to calculate Earthâs circumference, and to develop explanations of everything from the seasonal flooding of the Nile River to differences in population densities from place to place.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, geography ceased to be a major academic pursuit in Europe. Advances in geography were chiefly made by scientists of the Muslim world, based around the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa. Geographers of this Islamic Golden Age created the worldâs first rectangular map based on a grid, a map system that is still familiar today. Islamic scholars also applied their study of people and places to agriculture, determining which crops and livestock were most suited to specific habitats or environments.\n\nIn addition to the advances in the Middle East, the Chinese empire in Asia also contributed immensely to geography. Until about 1500, China was the most prosperous civilization on Earth. The Chinese were scientifically advanced, especially in the field of astronomy. Around 1000, they also achieved one of the most important developments in the history of geography: They were the first to use the compass for navigational purposes. In the early 1400s, the explorer Cheng Ho embarked on seven voyages to the lands bordering the China Sea and the Indian Ocean, establishing Chinaâs dominance throughout Southeast Asia.",

        "text": "Emergence of Modern Geography\n\nSome people have trouble understanding the complete scope of the discipline of geography because, unlike most other disciplines, geography is not defined by one particular topic. Instead, geography is concerned with many different topicsâpeople, culture, politics, settlements, plants, landforms, and much more. \n\nWhat distinguishes geography is that it approaches the study of diverse topics in a particular way (that is, from a particular perspective). Geography asks spatial questionsâhow and why things are distributed or arranged in particular ways on Earthâs surface. It looks at these different distributions and arrangements at many different scales. It also asks questions about how the interaction of different human and natural activities on Earthâs surface shape the characteristics of the world in which we live. \n\nGeography seeks to understand where things are found and why they are present in those places; how things that are located in the same or distant places influence one another over time; and why places and the people who live in them develop and change in particular ways. Raising these questions is at the heart of the âgeographic perspective.â\n\nExploration has long been an important part of geography. But exploration no longer simply means going to places that have not been visited before. It means documenting and trying to explain the variations that exist across the surface of Earth, as well as figuring out what those variations mean for the future. \n\nThe age-old practice of mapping still plays an important role in this type of exploration, but exploration can also be done by using images from satellites or gathering information from interviews. Discoveries can come by using computers to map and analyze the relationship among things in geographic space, or from piecing together the multiple forces, near and far, that shape the way individual places develop.\n\nApplying a geographic perspective demonstrates geographyâs concern not just with where things are, but with âthe why of whereââa short, but useful definition of geographyâs central focus.\n\nThe insights that have come from geographic research show the importance of asking âthe why of whereâ questions. Geographic studies comparing physical characteristics of continents on either side of the Atlantic Ocean, for instance, gave rise to the idea that Earthâs surface is comprised of large, slowly moving platesâplate tectonics. \n\nStudies of the geographic distribution of human settlements have shown how economic forces and modes of transport influence the location of towns and cities. For example, geographic analysis has pointed to the role of the U.S. Interstate Highway System and the rapid growth of car ownership in creating a boom in U.S. suburban growth after World War II. The geographic perspective helped show where Americans were moving, why they were moving there, and how their new living places affected their lives, their relationships with others, and their interactions with the environment.\n\nGeographic analyses of the spread of diseases have pointed to the conditions that allow particular diseases to develop and spread. Dr. John Snowâs cholera map stands out as a classic example. When cholera broke out in London, England, in 1854, Snow represented the deaths per household on a street map. Using the map, he was able to trace the source of the outbreak to a water pump on the corner of Broad Street and Cambridge Street. The geographic perspective helped identify the source of the problem (the water from a specific pump) and allowed people to avoid the disease (avoiding water from that pump).\n\n\nInvestigations of the geographic impact of human activities have advanced understanding of the role of humans in transforming the surface of Earth, exposing the spatial extent of threats such as water pollution by manmade waste. For example, geographic study has shown that a large mass of tiny pieces of plastic currently floating in the Pacific Ocean is approximately the size of Texas. Satellite images and other geographic technology identified the so-called âGreat Pacific Garbage Patch.â\n\nThese examples of different uses of the geographic perspective help explain why geographic study and research is important as we confront many 21st century challenges, including environmental pollution, poverty, hunger, and ethnic or political conflict.\n\nBecause the study of geography is so broad, the discipline is typically divided into specialties. At the broadest level, geography is divided into physical geography, human geography, geographic techniques, and regional geography. ",

        "text": "Physical Geography\n\nThe natural environment is the primary concern of physical geographers, although many physical geographers also look at how humans have altered natural systems. Physical geographers study Earthâs seasons, climate, atmosphere, soil, streams, landforms, and oceans. Some disciplines within physical geography include geomorphology, glaciology, pedology, hydrology, climatology, biogeography, and oceanography.\n\nGeomorphology is the study of landforms and the processes that shape them. Geomorphologists investigate the nature and impact of wind, ice, rivers, erosion, earthquakes, volcanoes, living things, and other forces that shape and change the surface of the Earth.\n\nGlaciologists focus on the Earthâs ice fields and their impact on the planetâs climate. Glaciologists document the properties and distribution of glaciers and icebergs. Data collected by glaciologists has demonstrated the retreat of Arctic and Antarctic ice in the past century.\n\nPedologists study soil and how it is created, changed, and classified. Soil studies are used by a variety of professions, from farmers analyzing field fertility to engineers investigating the suitability of different areas for building heavy structures.\n\nHydrology is the study of Earthâs water: its properties, distribution, and effects. Hydrologists are especially concerned with the movement of water as it cycles from the ocean to the atmosphere, then back to Earthâs surface. Hydrologists study the water cycle through rainfall into streams, lakes, the soil, and underground aquifers. Hydrologists provide insights that are critical to building or removing dams, designing irrigation systems, monitoring water quality, tracking drought conditions, and predicting flood risk.\n\nClimatologists study Earthâs climate system and its impact on Earthâs surface. For example, climatologists make predictions about El Nino, a cyclical weather phenomenon of warm surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. They analyze the dramatic worldwide climate changes caused by El Nino, such as flooding in Peru, drought in Australia, and, in the United States, the oddities of heavy Texas rains or an unseasonably warm Minnesota winter.\n\nBiogeographers study the impact of the environment on the distribution of plants and animals. For example, a biogeographer might document all the places in the world inhabited by a certain spider species, and what those places have in common.      \n\nOceanography, a related discipline of physical geography, focuses on the creatures and environments of the worldâs oceans. Observation of ocean tides and currents constituted some of the first oceanographic investigations. For example, 18th-century mariners figured out the geography of the Gulf Stream, a massive current flowing like a river through the Atlantic Ocean. The discovery and tracking of the Gulf Stream helped communications and travel between Europe and the Americas. \n\nToday, oceanographers conduct research on the impacts of water pollution, track tsunamis, design offshore oil rigs, investigate underwater eruptions of lava, and study all types of marine organisms from toxic algae to friendly dolphins.\n",

        "text": "Geographic Techniques\n\nSpecialists in geographic techniques study the ways in which geographic processes can be analyzed and represented using different methods and technologies. Mapmaking, or cartography, is perhaps the most basic of these. Cartography has been instrumental to geography throughout the ages. \n\nAs early as 1500 BCE, Polynesian navigators in the Pacific Ocean used complex maps made of tiny sticks and shells that represented islands and ocean currents they would encounter on their voyages. Today, satellites placed into orbit by the U.S. Department of Defense communicate with receivers on the ground called global positioning system (GPS) units to instantly identify exact locations on Earth. \n\nToday, almost the entire surface of Earth has been mapped with remarkable accuracy, and much of this information is available instantly on the internet. One of the most remarkable of these websites is Google Earth, which âlets you fly anywhere on Earth to view satellite imagery, maps, terrain, 3D buildings, from galaxies in outer space to the canyons of the ocean.â In essence, anyone can be a virtual Christopher Columbus from the comfort of home.\n\nTechnological developments during the past 100 years have given rise to a number of other specialties for scientists studying geographic techniques. The airplane made it possible to photograph land from above. Now, there are many satellites and other above-Earth vehicles that help geographers figure out what the surface of the planet looks like and how it is changing. \n\n\nGeographers looking at what above-Earth cameras and sensors reveal are specialists in remote sensing. Pictures taken from space can be used to make maps, monitor ice melt, assess flood damage, track oil spills, predict weather, or perform endless other functions. For example, by comparing satellite photos taken from 1955 to 2007, scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) discovered that the rate of coastal erosion along Alaskaâs Beaufort Sea had doubled. Every year from 2002 to 2007, about 45 feet per year of coast, mostly icy permafrost, vanished into the sea.\n\nComputerized systems that allow for precise calculations of how things are distributed and relate to one another have made the study of geographic information systems (GIS) an increasingly important specialty within geography. Geographic information systems are powerful databases that collect all types of information (maps, reports, statistics, satellite images, surveys, demographic data, and more) and link each piece of data to a geographic reference point, such as geographic coordinates. This data, called geospatial information, can be stored, analyzed, modeled, and manipulated in ways not possible before GIS computer technology existed. \n\nThe popularity and importance of GIS has given rise to a new science known as geographic information science (GISci). Geographic information scientists study patterns in nature as well as human development. They might study natural hazards, such as a fire that struck Los Angeles, California, in 2008. A map posted on the internet showed the real-time spread of the fire, along with information to help people make decisions about how to evacuate quickly. GIS can also illustrate human struggles from a geographic perspective, such as the interactive online map published by the New York Times in May 2009 that showed building foreclosure rates in various regions around the New York City area.\n\nThe enormous possibilities for producing computerized maps and diagrams that can help us understand environmental and social problems have made geographic visualization an increasingly important specialty within geography. This geospatial information is in high demand by just about every institution, from government agencies monitoring water quality to entrepreneurs deciding where to locate new businesses.\n",

Remote sensing includes imagery and other data collected from satellites, balloons, and drones.\n\nFinally, GIS can also include data in table or spreadsheet form, such as population demographics. Demographics can range from age, income, and ethnicity to recent purchases and internet browsing preferences.  \n\nGIS technology allows all these different types of information, no matter their source or original format, to be overlaid on top of one another on a single map. GIS uses location as the key index variable to relate these seemingly unrelated data. \n\nPutting information into GIS is called data capture. Data that are already in digital form, such as most tables and images taken by satellites, can simply be uploaded into GIS. Maps, however, must first be scanned, or converted to digital format.\n\nThe two major types of GIS file formats are raster and vector. Raster formats are grids of cells or pixels. Raster formats are useful for storing GIS data that vary, such as elevation or satellite imagery. Vector formats are polygons that use points (called nodes) and lines. Vector formats are useful for storing GIS data with firm borders, such as school districts or streets.\n\nSpatial Relationships\n\nGIS technology can be used to display spatial relationships and linear networks. Spatial relationships may display topography, such as agricultural fields and streams. They may also display land-use patterns, such as the location of parks and housing complexes.  \n\nLinear networks, sometimes called geometric networks, are often represented by roads, rivers, and public utility grids in a GIS. A line on a map may indicate a road or highway. With GIS layers, however, that road may indicate the boundary of a school district, public park, or other demographic or land-use area. Using diverse data capture, the linear network of a river may be mapped on a GIS to indicate the stream flow of different tributaries.   \n\nGIS must make the information from all the various maps and sources align, so they fit together on the same scale. A scale is the relationship between the distance on a map and the actual distance on Earth. \n\nOften, GIS must manipulate data because different maps have different projections. A projection is the method of transferring information from Earthâs curved surface to a flat piece of paper or computer screen. Different types of projections accomplish this task in different ways, but all result in some distortion. To transfer a curved, three-dimensional shape onto a flat surface inevitably requires stretching some parts and squeezing others. \n\nA world map can show either the correct sizes of countries or their correct shapes, but it canât do both. GIS takes data from maps that were made using different projections and combines them so all the information can be displayed using one common projection. ",

A human geographer might investigate the local, regional, and global impact of rising economic powers China and India, which represent 37 percent of the worldâs people. They also might look at how consumers in China and India adjust to new technology and markets, and how markets respond to such a huge consumer base.\n\nHuman geographers also study how people use and alter their environments. When, for example, people allow their animals to overgraze a region, the soil erodes and grassland is transformed into desert. The impact of overgrazing on the landscape as well as agricultural production is an area of study for human geographers.\n\nFinally, human geographers study how political, social, and economic systems are organized across geographical space. These include governments, religious organizations, and trade partnerships. The boundaries of these groups constantly change.\n\nThe main divisions within human geography reflect a concern with different types of human activities or ways of living. Some examples of human geography include urban geography, economic geography, cultural geography, political geography, social geography, and population geography. Human geographers who study geographic patterns and processes in past times are part of the subdiscipline of historical geography. Those who study how people understand maps and geographic space belong to a subdiscipline known as behavioral geography. \n\nMany human geographers interested in the relationship between humans and the environment work in the subdisciplines of cultural geography and political geography.\n\nCultural geographers study how the natural environment influences the development of human culture, such as how the climate affects the agricultural practices of a region. Political geographers study the impact of political circumstances on interactions between people and their environment, as well as environmental conflicts, such as disputes over water rights.\n\nSome human geographers focus on the connection between human health and geography. For example, health geographers create maps that track the location and spread of specific diseases. They analyze the geographic disparities of health-care access. They are very interested in the impact of the environment on human health, especially the effects of environmental hazards such as radiation, lead poisoning, or water pollution.\n",

A regional geographer might specialize in African studies, observing and documenting the people, nations, rivers, mountains, deserts, weather, trade, and other attributes of the continent. There are different ways you can define a region. You can look at climate zones, cultural regions, or political regions. Often regional geographers have a physical or human geography specialty as well as a regional specialty.\n\nRegional geographers may also study smaller regions, such as urban areas. A regional geographer may be interested in the way a city like Shanghai, China, is growing. They would study transportation, migration, housing, and language use, as well as the human impact on elements of the natural environment, such as the Huangpu River. \n\nWhether geography is thought of as a discipline or as a basic feature of our world, developing an understanding of the subject is important. Some grasp of geography is essential as people seek to make sense of the world and understand their place in it. Thinking geographically helps people to be aware of the connections among and between places and to see how important events are shaped by where they take place.  Finally, knowing something about geography enriches peopleâs livesâpromoting curiosity about other people and places and an appreciation of the patterns, environments, and peoples that make up the endlessly fascinating, varied planet on which we live.",

One of the most common uses of GIS technology involves comparing natural features with human activity.\n\nFor instance, GIS maps can display what man-made features are near certain natural features, such as which homes and businesses are in areas prone to flooding. \n\nGIS technology also allows users to âdig deepâ in a specific area with many kinds of information. Maps of a single city or neighborhood can relate such information as average income, book sales, or voting patterns. Any GIS data layer can be added or subtracted to the same map.  \n\nGIS maps can be used to show information about numbers and density. For example, GIS can show how many doctors there are in a neighborhood compared with the areaâs population. \n\nWith GIS technology, researchers can also look at change over time. They can use satellite data to study topics such as the advance and retreat of ice cover in polar regions, and how that coverage has changed through time. A police precinct might study changes in crime data to help determine where to assign officers. \n\nOne important use of time-based GIS technology involves creating time-lapse photography that shows processes occurring over large areas and long periods of time. For example, data showing the movement of fluid in ocean or air currents help scientists better understand how moisture and heat energy move around the globe.\n\nGIS technology sometimes allows users to access further information about specific areas on a map. A person can point to a spot on a digital map to find other information stored in the GIS about that location. For example, a user might click on a school to find how many students are enrolled, how many students there are per teacher, or what sports facilities the school has. \n\nGIS systems are often used to produce three-dimensional images. This is useful, for example, to geologists studying earthquake faults. \n\nGIS technology makes updating maps much easier than updating maps created manually. Updated data can simply be added to the existing GIS program. A new map can then be printed or displayed on screen. This skips the traditional process of drawing a map, which can be time-consuming and expensive.",

The wings are too small for gliding. However, by flapping them up to 400 times per minute, the birds stay in the air. These birds are Atlantic puffins.\nPuffins are excellent swimmers and divers. Using their wings to push along and webbed feet to steer, they dive 50 to 200 feet to find small fish and shrimp-like crustaceans. Puffins keep their eyes open while swimming. A puffin's eyes are protected by clear inner eyelids called nictitating membranes.\nHow do puffins get fresh water to drink in salty seas? Well, they have special salt glands above their eyes. These glands remove the salt from the water in their bloodstream. The salt drains out in a liquid through a puffin's nostrils and down grooves in its bills. The bird shakes its head, and the salt is gone.\nIn spring, Atlantic puffins come together in colonies on the islands and coastlands of the northeastern U.S. and Canada. Colony sizes range from a few hundred to hundreds of thousands. The feet and beaks of both males and females change from a dull winter gray to a bright orange. The color and the size of beaks may help birds decide on a mate.",

        "text": "Origin and history of cats\n\nThe âcat pattern,â established very early in the evolution of modern mammals, was a successful one: early cats were already typical in form at a time when the ancestors of most other modern mammalian types were scarcely recognizable. They first appeared in the early Pliocene Epoch (5.3 to 3.6 million years ago), and they have continued with remarkably little change into modern times.\nDomestication\n\nAlthough the origin of the domesticated cat is hidden in antiquity, studies involving mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) suggest that there have been two lineages of Felis catus. One lineage (F. silvestris silvestris) appeared in Asia Minor possibly as early as 6,400 years ago and dispersed northward and westward into Europe. The other lineage appeared in Egypt sometime between 6,400 and 1,000 years ago before spreading throughout the Mediterranean (possibly through human introduction) along paths that paralleled the regionâs trade routes. Cats of both lineages continued to breed with the African wildcat (F. silvestris lybica) during their respective dispersals.\nThe earliest known association between cats and humans dates possibly as far back as the origins of agriculture in the Middle East, about 9,500 years ago. A cat skeleton accompanying that of a human dated to that time was discovered in southern Cyprus. Although some sources note that this finding suggests that cats had undergone some degree of domestication in that location, other sources (citing evidence that the cat genome did not differ that much from that of the African wildcat during this period) argue that cats may have domesticated themselves by choosing to live in human-altered landscapes. Fossil evidence found in China dating to approximately 5,300 years ago revealed that cats similar in size to modern domestic cats fed on small grain-eating animals, such as rodents, and millet in agricultural settings. Although research suggests that these cats were actually leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis), which were replaced by modern domestic cats (F. catus) before 3000 BCE, this discovery suggests that humans allowed cats to hunt mice and other rodents that threatened grain stores and possibly fed the cats or allowed them to consume leftover food.\nAlthough the cat was proclaimed a sacred animal in Egypt in the 5th and 6th dynasties (c. 2465âc. 2150 BCE), it had not necessarily been domesticated at that time. It is probable that the ancient Egyptians partnered with the cat because they realized its value in protecting granaries from rodents. Their affection and respect for this predator led to the development of religious cat cults and temple worship of cats. There are no authentic records of domestication earlier than 1500 BCE, however.\n\nCats have long been known to other cultures. Wall tiles in Crete dating from 1600 BCE depict hunting cats. Evidence from art and literature indicates that the cat was present in Greece from the 5th century BCE, and tiles featuring cats appeared in China from 500 BCE. In India cats were mentioned in Sanskrit writings around 100 BCE, while the Arabs and the Japanese were not introduced to the cat until about 600 CE. The earliest record of cats in Britain dates to about 936 CE, when Howel Dda, prince of south-central Wales, enacted laws for their protection.\n\nEven though all cats are similar in appearance, it is difficult to trace the ancestry of individual breeds. Since tabbylike markings appear in the drawings and mummies of ancient Egyptian cats, present-day tabbies may be descendants of the sacred cats of Egypt. The Abyssinian also resembles pictures and statues of Egyptian cats. The Persian, whose colouring is often the same as that of mixed breeds (although the length of hair and the body conformation are distinctive), was probably crossed at various times with other breeds. The tailless Manx cat, like the hairless Sphynx cat and curly-coated Devon Rex, is a mutation. The ancestry of Persian and Siamese cats may well be distinct from that of other domestic breeds, representing a domestication of an Asian wild cat. In fact, nothing is known of the ancestry of the Siamese types, and there is no living species of Asian cat that could have served as ancestor.",

Often the cat has been associated with sorcery and witchcraft, and the superstitions regarding cats are innumerable.

During these periods, which last about five days, the cat âcalls,â or caterwauls, intermittently. The gestation period for cats averages 63 to 65 days, and birth usually lasts about two hours. The birth is often called kittening, and the kittens are called a litter. The average litter numbers four; however, the Abyssinian usually has fewer, the Siamese more.\n\nEach kitten is born in a separate amniotic sac that is generally broken open at the moment of birth. If it is not, the mother breaks it. She also severs the umbilical cord and eats the placenta (which in many cases stimulates lactation). The kittens are born blind, deaf, and helpless, as are many other carnivores; their senses begin to function 10 or 12 days after birth. Soon after birth the mother licks her kittens; this action cleans them and helps stimulate their circulation. Kittens at birth lack distinctive colouring, and many do not acquire their characteristic markings and colour for weeks. For example, Siamese kittens are white at birth, while blue Persians have tabby markings and black Persians are brown.\n\nUnlike wild cats that breed once a year, the domestic cat is capable of bearing up to three litters every year. Traditionally, regulation of the cat population was accomplished by the selective killing of the newborn. In modern times, however, sterilizationâby means of relatively safe and simple operations known as spaying, neutering, or alteringâhas become common in affluent societies. Neutering is also viewed as an adaptive measure for indoor life.\n\nCastration of the male, ideally around six or seven months of age, helps control the adult maleâs tendency to âsprayââto mark objects in and around the house with his own urine. Spaying the female may help reduce the incidence of breast cancer in addition to eliminating uterine diseases and unwanted litters.\n\nNeutered cats live longer than nonneutered ones, partly because they have less desire to roam.

The cat uses its canines to catch and kill prey, the molars to cut it up. Lack of flat-surfaced teeth prevents it from chewing or gnawing. The cat has a short intestine, and its stomach secretes digestive juices that act primarily on meat. Cats, however, like all meat-eating animals, ingest grass and other plants occasionally, and small quantities of vegetables may serve as both a laxative and a hair ball remover.\n\nAs cats are the strictest of all carnivorous mammals, they thrive on meat, but an all-meat diet is unbalanced and will lead to various nutritional deficiency diseases. Cats derive nutrients, including moisture, from their entire preyâhence the low thirst drive of most cats. Commercial dry pet foods, lacking moisture and overloaded with starches, are convenient for the owner but can contribute to many of the most common feline ailmentsâincluding obesity, urinary tract diseases, and diabetes mellitus. An obligate carnivoreâs system is not equipped to handle a high dietary proportion of carbohydrates or to digest grain matter (see nutrition: Carnivores). It is therefore prudent to examine the ingredient list on commercial cat foods, including âprescriptionâ foods, which often contain species-inappropriate ingredients that have no logical place in a catâs diet. In addition, seafood is not recommended; many cats are allergic to it, and it may be contaminated with hazardous chemicals.\n\nGetting as close to the natural carnivorous diet as possible by feeding a low-carbohydrate, meat-based diet can eliminate many of the most common ailments and diseases, which are not only painful for cats but also quite costly.

The catâs independent personality, grace, cleanliness, and subtle displays of affection have wide appeal. Typically, cats are creatures of habit; they are inquisitive, but not adventurous, and are easily upset by sudden changes of routine. The ideal household cat has been separated from its mother between the ages of two and four months, raised in a clean home, kept away from unhealthy animals, and inoculated against common infectious cat diseases. Although cats often enjoy the company of other cats, especially when raised together from kittenhood, introducing a strange cat to other cats in the home can cause stress, aggression, and other behaviour problems. Cats are generally less sociable than dogs, who more readily accept a new pack member.\n\nA good disposition and good health are important criteria for choosing a cat. Disposition varies only slightly between male and female cats. There are, however, distinct differences in disposition among the various pedigreed varieties; the Siamese, for example, is vocal and demanding, while the Persian is quiet and fastidious. The mixed breed, or âalley cat,â is a heterogeneous breed of unknown lineage; therefore, its disposition is difficult to assess. By chance, the mixed breed may prove a happier and healthier pet than a pedigreed one. On the other hand, the behaviour and vigour of the direct ancestors of pedigreed cats are indicative of the characteristics the offspring will possess as adults.

The size differences between breeds in the domestic dog have no parallel in the domestic cat, nor has anything even remotely approaching the wide range of head shapes and body proportions in different breeds of dogs ever appeared among the cats.

        "text": "What is Python? Executive Summary\nPython is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\n\nOften, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.",

This is because, although the product may be complicated, only a small investment is needed to fund the manufacture of many types of electronic components, especially in the software segment of this industry. However, these small companies are often bought by big revenue earners once they develop a hit product. Among computer hardware producers, the top names are Hitachi and Hewlett-Packard. Dell has been known for its direct-sale marketing strategy, yet in the rough times for PCâs of late has seen a considerable decline. The smaller companies that are not bought up must focus on differentiating their products and developing the brand name to compete with the diverse portfolios of the big companies.\n\nAs for software companies, Microsoft Corp., IBM, Google and Oracle Corp. rule the roost. These companies should not sit too easily though since recently consumer electronics products have been merging with products from the computer industry, for example phones now have Internet capability, as do game consoles, PDAs, and many other items. This convergence means that companies can expect increased competition from industries who were not previously direct competitors.

This business model has led other companies that have traditionally focused exclusively on software to also enter the hardware production industry.",

The metal ones also adhered more strongly in the wind, which was likely because the thin squiggly design of the metallic film allowed more of the tape to connect with the leaf surface. Next, the researchers created a plant-wearable device with the metal electrodes and attached it to a living plant in a greenhouse. The device wirelessly shared data to a smartphone app and website, and a simple, fast machine learning technique successfully converted these data to the percent of water content lost.

Despite intensive investigation, the primary cellular defect underlying impaired GCs in aging has not been identified. Here, we used heterochronic parabiosis to demonstrate that GC formation was dictated by the age of the lymph node (LN) microenvironment rather than the age of the immune cells. Lymphoid stromal cells are a key determinant of the LN microenvironment and are also an essential component underpinning GC structure and function. Using mouse models, we demonstrated that mucosal adressin cell adhesion moleculeâ1 (MAdCAM-1)âexpressing lymphoid stromal cells were among the first cells to respond to NP-KLH + Alum immunization, proliferating and up-regulating cell surface proteins such as podoplanin and cell adhesion molecules. This response was essentially abrogated in aged mice. By targeting TLR4 using adjuvants, we improved the MAdCAM-1+ stromal cell response to immunization. This correlated with improved GC responses in both younger adult and aged mice, suggesting a link between stromal cell responses to immunization and GC initiation. Using bone marrow chimeras, we also found that MAdCAM-1+ stromal cells could respond directly to TLR4 ligands. Thus, the age-associated defect in GC and stromal cell responses to immunization can be targeted to improve vaccines in older people.",

The new method, called 'maturation phase transient reprogramming', exposes cells to Yamanaka factors for just 13 days.

For example, Northeast China and the Sahel in Africa are predicted to receive more rain, which may help alleviate agricultural water scarcity. However, reduced precipitation in the midwestern U.S. and northwest India may lead to increases in irrigation to support intense farming.\n\nThe new index could help countries to assess the threat and causes of agricultural water scarcity and develop strategies to reduce the impact of future droughts.\n\nMultiple practices help conserve agricultural water. Mulching reduces evaporation from the soil, no-till farming encourages water to infiltrate the ground and adjusting the timing of plantings can better align crop growth with changing rainfall patterns. Additionally, contour farming, where farmers till the soil on sloped land in rows with the same elevation, prevents water runoff and soil erosion.",

To detect water loss earlier, researchers reporting in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces have created a wearable sensor for plant leaves. The system wirelessly transmits data to a smartphone app, allowing for remote management of drought stress in gardens and crops.\n\nNewer wearable devices are more than simple step-counters. Some smart watches now monitor the electrical activity of the wearer's heart with electrodes that sit against the skin. And because many devices can wirelessly share the data that are collected, physicians can monitor and assess their patients' health from a distance. Similarly, plant-wearable devices could help farmers and gardeners remotely monitor their plants' health, including leaf water content -- the key marker of metabolism and drought stress. Previously, researchers had developed metal electrodes for this purpose, but the electrodes had problems staying attached, which reduced the accuracy of the data. So, Renato Lima and colleagues wanted to identify an electrode design that was reliable for long-term monitoring of plants' water stress, while also staying put.",

In this programme he explores what happens when public art and people clash and gets a sense of what it's like when 'art comes in the night'. Whilst working on his own installation in Govan, he ponders what success and failure really mean in the sometimes controversial world of public art.\n\nSome public art is loved, some even defended from packs of roving art dealers, some is brushed off with indifference, or grumbling about wasted tax money. But when art comes out of the galleries and is splashed on the wall of someone's house or stuck outside on a shared stretch of grass the community can't help but be changed by its presence, and the art is at the mercy of those surrounding it.\n",

Men with wider faces were perceived as more dominant and electable, but the same wasn't true for women with wider faces.\n\nThe researchers found conservatives showed a stronger bias against women's faces to the point that they were less likely to elect a woman candidate due to a perceived association with lower dominance. Liberals indicated they were more likely to vote for a woman, but like conservatives, they also didn't perceive women with a wider face as more dominant.\n\n\"While there is a gender stereotype effect that does kick in for liberals, it isn't as strong, and on average they were more likely elect women and think of women as leaders,\" says Aggarwal.\n\nHe says one reason for this difference may come down to conservatives believing in maintaining social hierarchies, while liberals actively try to override this bias and create a less hierarchical society.",
